This is where bigotry leads and we can't afford it, not here, not anywhere else in America.\"\n\nClinton did not address her opponent, Donald Trump, by name but did spend a significant portion of her remarks laying out many of the contrasts she regularly draws with her opponent.

Yet as with almost any tool, mind control techniques can be used for the good of all of us or used to gain personal benefit at the expense of others.\n\nThough this lesson may be the most disturbing of all for some, it is also vitally important as far as understanding how some of the top secret, sophisticated operations which have a major impact on our world have been carried out. This topic also has some amazing healing applications. These applications and the deeper implications of all this information will be discussed at the end of the lesson.\n\nFirst, you are invited to explore some highly reliable information on how mind control has been used to forward hidden, disempowering agendas in our world.

Some nourished him, some, he found cured his ills, and some killed him. Few, to his surprise, had strange effects on his mind and body, seeming to carry him onto other worlds. We call these plants hallucinogens, because they distort the senses and usually produce hallucinations--experiences that depart from reality. Although most hallucinations are visual, they may also involve the senses of hearing, touch, smell, or taste--and occasionally several senses simultaneously...\"\n\n1 Schultes, The compounds that we call \"hallucinogenic\" are drugs that modify the function of the central nervous system by altering the input from the senses and changing the mood and behavior of the individual. These short term effects have caused some concern among our parents and leaders, but it is the long term influence that we will consider here. \"In the history of mankind, hallucinogens have probably been the most important of all the narcotics. Their fantastic effects made them sacred to primitive man and may even have been responsible for suggesting to him the idea of deity.\"\n\n2 Schultes, Dr. Richard Evan Schultes was no drug crazed hippy, but a respected Harvard professor with impeccable credentials. It was apparent to Dr. Schultes that hallucinogens were deeply involved in early religions. He also understood that to broadcast such views could be hazardous to one's career. Hence he confined his revolutionary discovery to one line in a popular guide to plant identification rather than publishing in some academic journal. When etymologist John Allegro went public with his discoveries linking early Christianity to hallucinogenic mushrooms, his career was ruined. It is indeed a subject that can cause deep emotional reaction. That was one of the early tipoffs that something important was going on here. There were such extreme reactions to inquiries about mushrooms that researchers had to come up with terms to describe mushroom haters and lovers. Whole cultures can be categorized by their view as to whether certain mushrooms are considered food or poison. Besides religion, the study involves ritual cannibalism, sex, and behavior modification. All of this is dangerous territory and may cause strong emotional reactions in the reader. If you DO have an emotional reaction to any of this material, you should sit very still, breath deeply and try to relax. Try to identify your feelings. Are you feeling anger? Frustration? Fear? Hatred? If these feelings are strong, you may want to quit reading. But please don't be mad at me. I'm just telling it like I see it. A certain amount of denial is necessary for survival in these troubling times. In order to function we all need a solid emotional state from which to operate. Like it or not, our basic beliefs, our \"World View\", is a major component of said state. Messing with your core beliefs can be tricky business. It hurts. It can cause damage; but so can ignoring the Truth. The trick is to use denial to keep your peace of mind, being careful not to be crushed by the Truth when it lands on you. Our beliefs are what holds us together. When the leaders we trust turn out to be liars, thieves and murders, it can shake our confidence and certainly be painful. The feeling of betrayal can lead to nearly uncontrollable anger. When our Gods betray us, it may be too much for some people to bear. Some folks might be better off if they just pass on this material and stick to their beliefs. Proceed at your own risk. However, if you are a seeker, and serious about \"meaning of life\" issues, you can't afford to turn back now. <- About | Next -> Sources\n\n\nClick on Author to return to quoted text. 1 Schultes, Hallucinogenic Plants, Golden Press, New York, 1976, p 5.\n\n2 Schultes, Hallucinogenic Plants, Golden Press, New York, 1976, p 5.", "greedy": "Intro \"In his search for food, early man tried all sorts of methods to find it.

The two got into an altercation and shot each other, Heiden said.\n\nThe other man went to a local hospital, where staff contacted police. The man has not been arrested, but police have identified him, according to Heiden. She said the man's relationship with McDonald is unclear and the investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"It wasn't a random event,\" Heiden said.\n\nWe're sorry, currently this live video stream is only available inside of Utah or an approved RSL broadcast territory.

That is why it was complicated for me.\"\n\nFormer Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit, alongside Diouf on TV show 'La Vestiare' questions: \"Are you talking about Steven Gerrard?\"\n\nDiouf responded: \"I do. Stevie G and Jamie Carragher, the two scousers.\"\n\nAsked about Gerrard's autobiography comment, Diouf responded: \"He was right, I am not a scouser.

For me in Liverpool, he was not just a player like anyone else. He had to work and play his football as I had to work and play my football.\n\n\"Then as you know, there were some brown-nosers, who went to the manager to repeat what I said. That was the real problem. When Gerrard did that, we had an argument, like real men.\n\n\"That is why he does not like me. He knows I say what I think, that when it is not right, no problem, I am up for it.\n\n\"He could not, he was afraid of looking into my eyes. He was afraid of talking to me.

(Photo: Susana Bates / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTesla Motors Inc. is the most recent automaker to bow out of next month's 2016 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.\n\nThe California-based electric car manufacturer joins Jaguar, Land Rover and BMW's Mini as brands opting to drive past the 2016 show after having a presence on the main show of Cobo Center in 2015.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson confirmed the move on Friday.\n\n\"After much consideration, we have decided against participating at the North American International Auto Show. We've always had a very good experience at Detroit,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"In Michigan, we have great owners, a strong supercharger network that connects the U.S. with Canada, and are continuing to hire talented employees. But as a small player, Tesla relies on auto shows to not only showcase our products, but engage with consumers and ultimately sell more cars in the region. We are working to change laws so that we are licensed to open stores and service vehicles. Until that happens NAIAS is not an optimal venue for driving our mission to put more EVs on the road.\"\n\nThe decision is in-line with comments made by Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla vice president of business development, on Nov. 20 in Detroit. He said he wasn't sure if the company would have a presence at the Detroit show and hinted the costs associated with a show might be too much especially since Tesla can't sell its vehicles in Michigan.\n\n\"The truth is there is a cost associated with being at these shows. And if you're trying to sell cars, that makes sense,\" he told reporters. \"Making the huge investments that go into setting up these booths and the staffing over the course of two weeks, particularly in a state like Michigan where we can't even sell cars, begs some questions.\"\n\nMax Muncey, the show's public relations manager, confirmed that Tesla informed officials that the company was not planning to purchase space on the show floor. A Tesla spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\"I'm very confident we will quickly fill that space,\" Muncey said. \"We're in talks with other automakers and partners. There's a lot of interest.\"\n\nO'Connell last month said Tesla's newest car \u2014 the Model 3 \u2014 is expected to go into production by the end of 2017 and consumers will get to see the car in March 2016, which is around the time of the New York International Auto Show.\n\nBoth Jaguar Land Rover and Mini cited the Detroit auto show not aligning with their respective brand strategies.\n\nHelping fill the voids will be newcomer the Robb Report and Aston Martin, which will return to the show for the first time since 2009.\n\n\"They don't attend any other auto shows, so to bring them back to the show was a great partner to have,\" Muncey said.\n\nThe Robb Report \u2014 recently purchased by prominent Detroit businessman Dan Gilbert, founder of Quicken Loans \u2014 is a magazine that features high-priced products.\n\nThe 2016 Detroit auto show is open to the public from Jan. 16-Jan. 26. Thousands of news media from more than 60 countries and industry officials also attend the show prior to it opening to the masses.\n\nSetting up the multimillion dollar stages, lighting and displays takes three months. Crews started preparing the space in mid-October. Event organizers say this year's setup is particularly important, as about 75 percent of the show floor will be all-new or significantly redesigned for the more than 40 expected worldwide debuts.\n\nmwayland@detroitnews.com\n\n(313) 222-2504\n\nStaff Writer Melissa Burden contributed\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1QiDEEt", "greedy": "The California-based electric car manufacturer joins Jaguar, Land Rover and Tesla in the race to build a self-driving car.\n\nThe company has been working on a self-driving car for more than a decade, but has been unable to produce a working prototype.\n\nThe company has been", "top-k": "The California-based electric car manufacturer joins Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo in the electric-car class.\n\n\"With the addition of Tesla's latest and most affordable Model 3 to our lineup of affordable electric vehicles we look forward to expanding our offerings and introducing a range of electric vehicles in our portfolio", "beam": "The California-based electric car manufacturer joins Jaguar, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz in the race to build the world's first mass-produced electric car.\n\n\"We are very excited to be working with Jaguar Land Rover on the development of the Jaguar I-PACE electric vehicle,\" said Dr", "greedy_mauve": 0.9089081657455247, "top-k_mauve": 0.9252658488826699, "beam_mauve": 0.944448898121508}, {"id": 255016, "ended": true, "length": 92, "text": "The Owings Mills Mall in Maryland officially closed its doors in 2015, with the final store closing in 2016.

Last week, London-based fashion label KTZ were in hot water over the \"Shaman Towelling Sweatshirt\" featured in their AW15 collection \u2013 a design which Salome Awa says was copied from her great-grandfather Aua, one of the last Shaman of the Canadian Inuit.\n\n\"They must have seen it and copied it,\" Awa told The Evening Standard, \"They even called the clothing Shaman...

As well as emphasising the multiculturalism of their company, they said that the Inuit community was credited in the press release and that they have already removed the item from sale.\n\nAwa's response to the apology was bittersweet, telling CBC North, \"\"I'm kind of happy about it but sad at the same time... They didn't even mention an apology to my great-grandfather and they didn't even offer any monetary gains to our family... This is a stolen piece. There is no way that this fashion designer could have thought of this exact duplicate by himself.\" Awa goes on to say that she has some questions from the brand. \"Why did you not ask us in the first place?\" she asks. \"How they obtained the exact replica?

Bulkowski. All rights reserved. Disclaimer: You alone are responsible for your investment decisions. See Privacy/Disclaimer for more information. Some pattern names are the registered trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nStatistics updated on 8/17/18\n\nFor more information on this pattern, read Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns Second Edition , pictured on the right, pages 149 to 163. That chapter gives a complete review of the chart pattern, compared to what is described below.\n\nCup-with-Handle\n\nImportant Bull Market Results for Cup with Handle Overall performance rank (1 is best): not ranked Break even failure rate: 5% Average rise: 52% Throwback rate: 62% Percentage meeting price target: 62% The above numbers are based on 912 perfect trades. See the glossary for definitions.\n\nCup with Handle Identification Guidelines\n\nCharacteristic Discussion Price trend Upward leading to the pattern. I use a 6-month look back (high to high). If price is higher at pattern start than 6 months ago, then I accept it. Otherwise, I visually check to see it's in a short-term uptrend. I no longer require a 30% upward move. Shape A rounded turn that looks like a cup with a handle on the right. U-shaped cup The cup should be U-shaped, not V-shaped. Handle The cup must have a handle on the right. Cup duration From 7 to 65 weeks Handle duration 1 week minimum with no maximum. Handle Forms in upper half of cup. Cup Cup rims should be near the same price level but be flexible.\n\nCup with Handle Trading Tips\n\nConsult the associated figure on the right.\n\nTrading Tactic Explanation Measure rule Measure the height from the right cup lip ( A ) to the lowest valley ( B ) then multiply by the above 'percentage meeting price target.' Add the result to the breakout price ( A ) to get a target. Inner cup Cups often form within cups (points 1 and 2 ), so trade the inner cup when price rises above the handle (the dashed green line at point 3 ). Trendline If possible, draw a down-sloping trendline along the handle peaks. A close above the trendline signals an early buy. I show this as the blue line extending down from point A on the chart to the right. Buy Buy when price closes above the right cup rim (point A , and the top horizontal red line). Stop The handle low (point C ) is a good place to put a stop. Raise the stop as price rises. Throwbacks Throwbacks hurt performance. Short handle Stocks with handles shorter than the median 22 days show superior post breakout performance. The Measure Rule\n\nCup with Handle Example\n\nThe figure on the right shows an example of a cup with handle chart pattern. The rise leading to the cup with handle begins at C and reaches the left cup lip at point A . Since this is on the weekly scale, the price chart appears narrower than usual, but price rounds downward forming a cup with the right cup lip at B . The handle lasts a few weeks before price begins moving up. The next week, price rockets upward about seven points.\n\n-- Thomas Bulkowski\n\nOther Cup with Handle Examples", "greedy": "Written by and copyright \u00a9 2005-2018 by Thomas N. Bulkowski.

Cook is catching the eye of his teammates and coaches, and currently possesses workhorse potential in Minnesota.\n\nA succession of poor decisions off the field, ball security issues on the field and a mediocre combine dropped the uber-talented Dalvin Cook all the way to pick No. 41 to the Minnesota Vikings \u2014 who let Vikings legend and seven-time All-Pro Adrian Peterson walk in free agency, while adding goal line hammer Latavius Murray in March.\n\nAfter Christian McCaffrey came off the board, us at the Roto Street Journal were pleading for a team like the Bucs, Raiders or Packers to select Cook. Once the Vikings drafted Cook, the fantasy community broke out in a cold sweat. Minnesota does very little to help out their running backs: from their porous offensive line, to their up-and-down passing situation and blah-scheme, it's tough to be a running back for the purple and gold.\n\nThe Wolf was especially hurt by this combination, stating:\n\nCook landed in arguably the worst spot possible with Minnesota. Indeed, the talent is there, but that's about all he has working in his favor. The team dished out oodles of money for Latavius Murray, who will undoubtedly be involved, especially near the stripe. Additionally, the line is among the worst in football, and there's little else really threatening defenses or creating TD opportunities. Throw in a bland, vanilla scheme, and Cook will be relying on his own high-end abilities to produce any fantasy value in 2017.\n\nAlthough Murray had the highest percentage of carries inside the 5-yard line last season (81.8 percent in Oakland), we didn't take the severity of his ankle injury into account before grading out Cook's situation. The reason why Murray took multiple free agent visits was to prove to teams in person that the bone spurs in his ankle were not serious, and the Vikings took the bait. The former Raider underwent surgery on his ankle a week after signing and was expected to be ready for the start of training camp.\n\nFast forward to the start of training camp, and Latavius Murray is still MIA. In fact, on July 31st, Murray put no timetable on his return and would only commit to the regular season. After missing the entire offseason program and the start of camp with his new team, a frustrated Murray stated that he's \"behind the 8-ball.\" He went onto say, \"if I'm not healthy, there's no point in me being out there. If I'm not good out there, I can't help the team regardless.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the rookie running back is taking full advantage of his opportunity by taking the majority of the first team reps and he's caught the attention of his teammates and coaches.\n\n\"The first thing the veteran players I've talked to about him say is, 'This guy gets it.'\" coach Mike Zimmer explained after a practice. \"He understands protections, he works hard, they see how he interacts in the locker room, and that's part of it. And then, when you have a special player\u2014like when we got [linebacker Anthony] Barr\u2014they say, 'Hey, man, this guy is different than other guys.' \"That's kinda how he is. They see him out there on the field with the other guys, and it's like, 'There's something different about this guy, the way he runs, accelerates, the creases he can get to.' He's got a tough mentality. Players can see exceptional athletes. When they go out there and they're going against guys, they can see: This guy is pretty good.\"\n\nAs one can see, it's safe to say that Dalvin Cook has earned the staff's trust, and with Murray still sidelined, he's truly entering a workhorse role.

But amid all the scorn, one question has yet to be asked about the resiliency of the terror army, which actually goes to the heart of its decade-old war doctrine. Namely: Does ISIS actually win even when it loses?\n\nThis isn't an academic issue. America's allies in the ISIS war are gearing up for a major counteroffensive against the extremist group. That assault that could very well play right into ISIS's hands.\n\nHaving superimposed its self-styled \"caliphate\" over a good third of Iraq's territory, in control of two provincial capitals, ISIS is today in the strongest position it has ever been for fomenting the kind of sectarian conflagration its founding father, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, envisioned as far back as 2004.\n\nZarqawi's end-game was simple: by waging merciless atrocities against Iraq's Shia majority population (and any Sunnis seen to be conspiring with it), Zarqawi's jihadists would have only to stand back and watch as radicalized Shia militias, many of whose members also served in various Iraqi government and security roles, conducted their own retaliatory campaigns against the country's Sunni minority. Internecine conflict would have the knock-on effect of driving Sunnis desperately into the jihadist fold, whether or not they sympathized with the ideology of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Zarqawi's franchise and the earliest incarnation of what we now call the Islamic State.\n\nIndeed, in the mid-2000s, the Jordanian jihadist nearly got what he wished for by waging spectacular terror attacks against Shia civilians and holy sites, such as the Golden Mosque in Samarra, a strategy which quickened devolved Iraq's violence from a primarily anti-American insurgency into all-out civil war. The only stopgap for a truly apocalyptic or nation-destroying result was the presence of nearly 200,000 U.S. and coalition troops. Today, however, absent such a foreign and independent military presence, the main actors left in Iraq are the same extremists\u2014Shia militias and ISIS.\n\nThis fact was only driven home last week after thousands of U.S.-trained Iraqi Security Force personnel, including the elite counterterrorist Golden Division, fled from Ramadi, allowing the city fall to a numerically modest contingent of ISIS jihadists. Having been initially instructed by Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to refrain from defending the city (no doubt at the prompting of Washington) the Hashd al-Shaabi, the umbrella organization for these Shia militias, now say they are prepping a massive counteroffensive to retake Ramadi. It promises to be a drawn-out and highly fraught counteroffensive, pitting paramilitaries\u2014which have been accused of war crimes and atrocities by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2014against genocidal ISIS militants.\n\nMany Iraqis fear, with good reason, that this counteroffensive will also extend to Sunni civilians who will now be branded \"collaborators\" of ISIS, as they have in previous Hashd-led operations. The result: torture, extrajudicial killing, and ethnic cleansing. Nothing would better serve the ISIS narrative or legitimate its claim to be the last custodian and safeguard of Sunni Muslims in the Middle East. Such an outcome might even precede the eventual disintegration of the modern state of Iraq into warring ethno-religious enclaves. That this was ISIS's plan all along adds yet another grim paragraph to the obituary of American-hatched adventurism in the Middle East.\n\nTrue, Hashd al-Shaabi has routed ISIS elsewhere before, namely in Amerli and Jurf al-Sakhar and Tikrit. In the aftermath, the militia was accused of committing human rights abuses, but those accusations didn't tear the country apart.\n\nThe difference with Ramadi, however, is one of both scale and symbolism. This city of close to 200,000 is dead center in the Sunni heartland of Iraq, where ISIS has the home advantage. Ramadi was also, not coincidentally, the cynosure of the so-called \"Anbar Awakening,\" which saw hundreds of thousands of Sunni tribesmen rise up against ISIS's predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq, in a cautious but fruitful partnership with American soldiers in the mid-2000s, a grassroots counterinsurgency whose gains were then solidified by the \"surge\" orchestrated by U.S. commander General David Petraeus. This time, absent any American combat forces, there are Shia Islamists who have never before tread into Ramadi. Many Iraqis dread the consequences.\n\n\"Iraq is not unified,\" Iraq's former Deputy Prime Minister Rafe Essawi, a senior Sunni political leader originally from Anbar, told The Daily Beast. \"Fifty percent of the country belongs either to Kurds or ISIS, and 50 percent belongs", "greedy": "The Obama administration is being slammed from all sides for its handling of the Benghazi attack.\n\nThe White House has been accused of not doing enough to protect the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and other Americans in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nThe administration has been criticized", "top-k": "The Obama administration is being slammed from all sides for using its bully pulpit to push for a \"one size fits all\" approach to gun control that will result in a \"staggering spike\" in gun fatalities, and the NRA is blasting the president for not taking a firm stand on guns and", "beam": "The Obama administration is being slammed from all sides for its handling of the Ebola crisis.\n\nThe White House has been criticized for not doing enough to stop the spread of the deadly virus, which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa.\n\nThe White House has been criticized for", "greedy_mauve": 0.9636407969469745, "top-k_mauve": 0.9400698532425629, "beam_mauve": 0.9667228507350798}, {"id": 255023, "ended": true, "length": 243, "text": "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reinforced what private-sector economists have been saying for months: The best proposals to spur the economy would cost the government but prove better at quickly creating jobs than pursuing an anti-regulatory policy as proposed Republicans in Congress.\n\nCBO Director Douglas Elmendorf said extending unemployment benefits or payroll tax breaks to those who are most likely to spend the money, as well as providing as tax credits to companies that hire new workers, are among the types of policies that could best boost the economy and create jobs.

Here is the backstory.\n\nOne of the reasons repeatedly stated by President George W. Bush for the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the maintenance of \"torture rooms\" by Saddam Hussein. While making this very argument, Bush was secretly authorizing CIA agents to engage in similar unlawful behavior for similar purposes: intelligence and deterrence. Bush sounded credible when he claimed that his administration adhered to federal and international legal standards.\n\nHe knew he could make that claim because the torturers were sworn to secrecy, as were their congressional regulators. The CIA charter permits Congress to regulate the CIA in secret. Congress has established two secret congressional committees, one from the Senate and one from the House, to serve as monitors and regulators of CIA activities. The stated reason for the secrecy is to keep our enemies from knowing what the CIA is doing. The effect of the secrecy has been a muzzled Congress, lied to by law-breaking and rogue CIA officials.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWhen the Senate Intelligence Committee staff learned of the destroyed videotapes (a federal crime the Justice Department declined to prosecute) and reported that destruction to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the committee chair, she ordered an investigation to determine whether the CIA officials who had briefed her committee had told the truth. If they had been truthful, she reasoned, why destroy the tapes? In order to conduct that investigation, Feinstein ordered the CIA to make available to her committee's investigators whatever documents and digital data the investigators sought.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, Senate investigators suspected their computers had been hacked. When they brought those suspicions to Feinstein, she ordered another investigation, this one aimed at identifying the hackers. That investigation revealed that the CIA itself was spying on its own Senate investigators. When she approached CIA Director John Brennan about this, he denied it. When she went to the floor of the Senate\u2014where her vow of secrecy may lawfully be disregarded\u2014to reveal that the CIA had spied on her and her fellow Senators and their investigators, the CIA denied it. When she released incontrovertible evidence of CIA domestic spying, Brennan admitted that his agents had spied on their regulators (another federal crime the feds declined to prosecute), but claimed it was needed because the regulators had exceeded their authority in examining CIA documents.\n\nAll this put the original investigation of why the tapes of the torture had been destroyed and whether the CIA had been truthful to the White House and its congressional regulators into high gear. When the investigators' final report\u2014all 6,000 pages of it, much in lurid detail\u2014was completed, it was sent to the White House, which decided to release it. The CIA begged for redactions of agents' names and other identifiers, and a long process of negotiation ensued between the White House, the State Department, the CIA, and the Senate. This week, Feinstein had had enough and decided to release the report with the then-agreed-upon redactions.\n\nThe report is damning in the extreme to the Bush administration and to the CIA leadership. It offers proof that the CIA engaged in physical and psychological torture, some of which was authorized\u2014unlawfully, yet authorized\u2014and most of which was not. The report also demonstrates that CIA officials repeatedly lied to the White House and to Senate regulators about what they were doing, and they lied about the effectiveness of their torture.\n\nIf the allegations in the report are true, we have war criminals, perjurers, computer hackers and thugs on the government payroll. We also have dupes. The most politically successful argument the torture lobby has made is that we are all safer because of these dirty deeds. This Senate report refutes that argument by demonstrating that no serious actionable intelligence came from the torture.\n\nAll torture is criminal under all circumstances\u2014under treaties to which the U.S. is a party, under the Constitution that governs the government wherever it goes, and under federal law. Torture degrades the victim and the perpetrator. It undermines the moral authority of a country whose government condones it. It destroys the rule of law. It exposes our own folks to the awful retaliatory beheadings we have all seen. It is slow, inefficient, morbid, and ineffective. It is a recruiting tool for those who have come to cause us harm. All human beings possess basic inalienable rights derived from the natural law and protected by the Constitution the CIA has sworn to uphold.

But in order to gather the necessary information you need on a hike, a quality laser rangefinder can help you figure out the distance to your next location. This not only provides climbers with an understanding of distances, but it also helps to increase safety by providing accurate and reliable information from which climbers can use to make important decisions, especially on more dangerous and technical routes.\n\nAnother great feature of laser rangefinders are their compatibility. When you're out climbing mountains, the last thing you need is more stuff weighing you down. A majority of laser rangefinders are designed to fit inside your bag with no problem. Depending on your preference, rangefinders for mountaineering can also be handheld or come with a tripod for added stability.\n\nHunting is all about precision and accuracy. Make any small mistake and that opportunity you had can disappear in seconds. That is why hunters strive to remove all of the unpredictable or unknown variables that they can, ensuring the best chance of making the shot. That is why rangefinders are becoming more in more popular in the hunting world. Rangefinders can provide hunters with the exact distances between them and their targets.\n\nThis takes a lot of guesswork and estimating out of the equation which highly increases the chances of a successful shot. There are rangefinders that can be found designed for the sole purpose of hunting. Some models are designed for hand-held usage, while others include mounts or poles. Still, some other models mount directly onto your hunting weapon of choice, whether that be a bow, rifle and more.\n\nSome of the major manufacturers of laser rangefinders include Bushnell, Luepold, hunting giant Cabela, and even some camera manufacturers such as Nikon and Canon produce their own quality laser rangefinders. Depending on the laser rangefinder itself and the manufacturer, their specificity of use may differ. For those wanting to use a rangefinder for only hunting, it would be wise to purchase one from a company who specializes in this field. The same goes for those looking for laser rangefinders for the sole purpose of mountaineering. In effect, all laser rangefinders accomplish the same task, but some added features can specialize it to the user's particular needs.\n\nWhether you are climbing a mountain or heading out for a weekend of hunting, guessing distances won't help you succeed. Take away all of the doubts and guessing by utilizing a laser rangefinder. The sheer accuracy of these tools will make sure that all of the unknown variables are removed.

The cards we run aren't individually powerful, most die like flies, but have a lot of potential for a tempo'y deck where you counter, blink or hexproof all of your opponent's attempts of dealing with your prodding.\n\nEach creature does something extra for the greater good, allowing everyone to keep pressure up.\n\nRattlechains: Keep in mind that playing this on the end step gives your opponent the chance to remove it when its Hexproof is still on the stack.\n\nBygone Bishop, Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit: Although these are great engines, generally might be a good idea to hold these back until you're up 1-2 mana to protect them with a counterspell / Essence Flux. Generally, losing your guys to removal kills your tempo pretty hard.\n\nThunderclap Wyvern: Surprisingly, since you often have 1-2 flyers out at any point, this can swing the game in your favor in a major way. Depending on your opponent, consider playing this with a counterspell up.\n\nStratus Dancer: Still in testing, this might end up in the sideboard. Not having your guys die as they keep smashing in is what the deck is all about. Doesn't synergize well with Essence Flux though, which is a shame.\n\nNegate: I find it mandatory, at the very least very important to run this as a 4x in main. So far I haven't been able to reliably aggro with this deck, absolutely everything dies to removal, Planeswalkers wreck us and ramp/draw effects quickly leave us behind. 4x Negate is well enough to make it unsafe for your opponent to freely cast their things and allows you to further mess up their tempo by taking out key spells.\n\nSurprisingly, creatures haven't been a problem to this deck at all. 4-5x Silkwrap/Stasis Snare and Reflector Mage are easily enough to keep the board clear enough for you. You don't need to remove everything and a lot of the time the creatures our opponents have aren't a big deal. Gives even further reasons for running Negate.\n\nEssence Flux: Even though Flux doens't seem amazing, it does something against absolutely every deck and it comboes with every card at least decently. Targetting Topplegeist makes it a buff and a combat trick while dodging a removal. To Rattlechains it's a buff and saves up to two targets from removal. With Reflector Mage you get another bounce while dodging. Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit gives you more counters on top of more counters. While you may not always want Flux, it's such a flexible card that really holds the deck together.\n\nOjutai's Command: I consider this a resiliency play - The average use I see is bringing Rattlechains back and drawing a card, although countering a big creature and drawing/bringing Rattlechains back is a decent one too. I haven't tested this too much, but it seems to do a lot to fix the biggest problem with this deck - losing Rattlechains before it can be replaced.\n\nAny feedback and criticism especially is welcome, wanted and encouraged!

There are of course many ways to purge, sort, and organize fabric, which I'll write about later. But first, I wanted to address questions about the folding station and the folding method we used.\n\nIt's the same method I've been using as I've been sorting and organizing fabric in my own apartment. Here you see an in-progress picture of my new studio corner with stacks of uniformly-folded fabric. This is a method I first read about from Monica, the Happy Zombie and later from Marilyn Bohn's video.\n\nOf course there are other ways, but this is the cheap, easy, quick one that works for me. The goal is to end up with a stack of fabric that is uniformly folded \u2014 the same length and width.\n\nThe height of each folded piece varies according to how much yardage you have to begin with.\n\nTo accomplish this, you'll need a stack of fabric (45\u2033 wide works best, though other widths can be accommodated), a flat surface, and a large quilter's ruler. My mom had three 6.5\u2033-wide rulers, so we defaulted to using those for her project. However, the cubbies on my shelf are 13\u2033 wide. In order to comfortably fit 2 stacks of fabric side-to-side, I needed to use a slightly smaller ruler. Mine is 6\u2033 wide and 24\u2033 long.\n\nI don't currently have any fabric that hasn't been folded by this method, so I had to un-fold a piece to show you how it's done. Pardon the creases!\n\nFirst, ensure that the fabric is folded in half lengthwise (selvedge-to-selvedge) with the wrong sides together. Many fabrics (including most quilter's cotton) are approximately 45\u2033 wide, which leaves you with a span of fabric around 22\u2033 after it's folded in half. For my ruler of 24\u2033, this is just perfect. It leaves a little bit of ruler poking out on either end.\n\nBegin \"wrapping\" the fabric around the ruler, starting with the raw edge nearest to you. It's almost like you're making a small \"bolt\" of fabric with the quilter's ruler where the cardboard core would be.\n\nContinue wrapping (flipping the ruler away from you) until you reach the other raw edge of the fabric. At this point, you have two options.\n\nIf the remaining edge is wide enough, you can just fold it over. However, if that edge piece is too small and won't lie flat, there is another option.\n\nIf the last wrapped edge is too small to lie flat, unfold the bolt of fabric and tuck the edge under. Then, flip the bolt on top of the fold and it will seal the edge up into the wraps of fabric.\n\nPull the ruler out from the center of the fabric. Make sure that it lies flat and the raw edge doesn't pop out.\n\nFold the fabric in half cross-wise. (Hamburger fold, not hotdog.)\n\nPlace your folded fabric on the shelf with the folded edge facing you. that way, you can see at a glance what colors of fabric you've got.\n\nYou can see that the finished piece is a little larger than 6\u2033 wide, and about 11\u2033 long. This will vary depending on your ruler, so make sure you understand your shelves or storage spaces before you have to unfold your whole collection!\n\nA lot of people store their fat quarters separate from the rest of their fabric collection. My mom wanted hers kept separate, so we did what Monica Zombie suggested and folded the fat quarters in the same way but with a smaller ruler. I prefer to keep my fabric all together, since I'm generally hunting for fabric of a certain color, rather than of a certain size.\n\nA fat quarter is generally around 18\u2033 x 22\u2033. Using my 6\u2033 ruler allows me to make a tidy little bolt and store all of my fabric in one place.\n\nFold one edge in\u2026\n\nThen the other.\n\nJust as before, remove the ruler and fold in half.\n\nVoila! If you're starting with 60\u2033 fabric, vintage sheets, or other odd-sized pieces, the procedure is the same. All you have to do is fold it lengthwise (hotdog, not hamburger) to approximately 20-24\u2033 wide before you begin wrapping. For a 60\u2033 piece, I generally just fold it in thirds lengthwise and it pretty much evens out in the end.\n\nBe aware that extra yardage (3+ yards) will yield pieces that are noticeably wider due to the sheer bulk of fabric as you wrap around and around. You may need to take this into account as you plan out the size of your storage system", "greedy": "Several people have asked about the techniques we used when we were working on the game.

Jason Brezler received support and endorsements from congressmen, a former assistant secretary of defense, and even Marine Corps generals at his board of inquiry, a panel of three officers recommended Thursday that he be separated from the Marine Corps with an honorable discharge.\n\nAfter three days of testimony and arguments and more than two hours of deliberation, the board, composed of Col. James Iulo, Col. Bart Pester and Lt. Col. Todd Manyx, found that Brezler, a Reserve officer and New York City firefighter, had demonstrated substandard conduct, misconduct or professional or moral dereliction, and conduct unbecoming an officer by failing to observe correct protocols for handling classified information. He doesn't deserve to stay in the Corps, they concluded.\n\nBrezler came under investigation in 2012 when he received an urgent email from then-Capt. Andrew Terrell regarding Sarwar Jan, a corrupt Afghan police chief with known Taliban ties and a penchant for child sex abuse who had gained access to a Marine base. Brezler, attending a graduate school seminar in Oklahoma at the time, fired off a classified briefing document about Jan from his Yahoo account.\n\nWhen another officer who received the email raised the alarm about sending the document over a nonsecure network, Brezler reported himself to his superiors and cooperated with a Naval Criminal Investigative Service probe into the classified material spillage. The probe turned up another folder with some 106 documents marked secret. Brezler said he inadvertently brought them back with him following his 2010 deployment to Now Zad, Afghanistan, where limited resources sometimes meant Marines worked on their personal computers and thumb drives.\n\nSeventeen days after Brezler sent the document about Sarwar Jan, one of the teenage boys whom Jan kept on base grabbed a rifle and killed three Marines, seriously wounding another.\n\nTestifying in his own defense Thursday morning, Bezler said his response \"was just visceral\" when he received the email regarding Jan. \"His name brought me great concern, knowing he was somewhere in the battlespace. I immediately responded.\"\n\nWhen he learned about the deaths of the three Marines, he felt that his worst fears had come true, Brezler said.\n\nBut a Marine prosecutor said this week that the case was about more than that one communication with Marines in Afghanistan. Brezler knowingly kept classified documents to inform a book he was writing about his Now Zad experiences, said Maj. Chip Hodge, showing that Brezler had copied and pasted a paragraph from the Sarwar Jan document into his manuscript, \"Rebirth of Apocalypse Now Zad.\"\n\nBrezler was feigning ignorance by saying he had taken the documents home by mistake and that he used the Sarwar Jan information in his manuscript without realizing it was classified, Hodge said.\n\n\"He knew [the classified information] was there. He knew he had access to it. He knew where to go for it,\" said Hodge. \"... [Brezler] didn't think the rules applied to him.\"\n\nBrezler's defenders are many. His attorneys, Maj. Amelia Kays and Kevin Carroll, submitted 60 letters of recommendation to the board, which included praise from Marine generals. On Wednesday, nine witnesses testified in his defense, including three of his commanding officers and bestselling author Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense.\n\nFirst Marine Division commander Maj. Gen. Lawrence Nicholson, commander of the 1st Marine Division, wrote that Brezler's contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan \"rank among the most important I've seen in the most challenging settings.\"\n\nJohn Kael Weston, a former State Department official who has advised Marine generals in Iraq and who met Brezler in Now Zad, said his separation would be a loss for the country.\n\n\"We need a bench of experienced officers so our nation is prepared the next time we need a Marine Corps,\" he said. With Brezler's separation, he said, \"The Marine Corps loses, he obviously loses, but we as a nation lose.\"\n\nThe case has also received a flurry of press attention from media outlets nationally and in Brezler's home state of New York, with many asking why Brezler was investigated so aggressively after trying to inform fellow Marines about a perceived threat.\n\nIn his closing argument, Hodge pulled up a Google page showing all the news search results under Brezler's name, suggesting the media coverage following the case should play into the board's deliberation.\n\n\"There are likely millions of people around the country waiting for your decision,\" he said. \"Do we want good military character to trump military actions?\"\n\nBrezler also has been defended by Sen.", "greedy": "source GAIA package: Sx_MilitaryTimes_M6201310312190030_5675.zip Origin key: Sx_MilitaryTimes_M6201310312190030 imported at Fri Jan 13 20:01:21 2013 by Sx_MilitaryTimes_M62013", "top-k": "source GAIA package: Sx_MilitaryTimes_M6201310312190030_5675.zip Origin key: Sx_MilitaryTimes_M6201310312190030 imported at Fri, 28 Jan 2013 11:24:44 +0100 MIME-Version: 1.", "beam": "source GAIA package: Sx_MilitaryTimes_M6201310312190030_5675.zip Origin key: Sx_MilitaryTimes_M6201310312190030 imported at Fri Sep 28 08:03:54 BST 2013.

Police had earlier advised residents on the block where the device was found to stay away from windows facing 27th Street.\n\nThere were other suspicious packages and incidents in the area since the pressure cooker was discovered, but they were deemed not dangerous, police said.\n\nBomb-sniffing dogs deployed in NYC's Chelsea neighborhood after reported explosion.

A public funeral is planned for Thursday. The 22-year-old died yesterday less than a week after being returned to Ohio from North Korea in a coma. Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center described his condition as a state of unresponsive wakefulness. President Trump talked about Warmbier's death today.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a total disgrace what happened to Otto. That should never ever be allowed to happen. And frankly, if he were brought home sooner, I think the result would have been a lot different.\n\nMCEVERS: One of the people who had been working to get Warmbier released sooner is former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. His foundation, the Richardson Center, helps negotiate the release of political prisoners. Richardson started working on the case just after Warmbier was detained in January 2016, and he says he had a lot of meetings with North Korean officials.\n\nBILL RICHARDSON: I've talked to him a total myself and my chief of staff 20 times in New York. My executive director, Mickey Bergman, went to North Korea at the end of the year with the support of the Obama administration. We offered private humanitarian aid. North Koreans never responded. They never said yes or no. They never agreed to have me visit as I have in the past - a total mystery but obviously a real cover-up.\n\nMCEVERS: What do you think happened?\n\nRICHARDSON: What I think happened is that the North Koreans engaged in some kind of interrogation, and the interrogation went wrong, that it affected his brain, that he then went into a coma. I don't think they're foolish enough to engage and torture a 21-year-old boy who just stole a political banner. Yeah, he's a bargaining chip, but there's no reason why he might have been tortured.\n\nBut with the North Koreans in the past, you could get prisoners out in exchange for high-level visits, humanitarian assistance. With Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea now, we could make a deal with his father on prisoners, and we've been able to but not with this man. We don't know what he wants. We don't know what makes him tick. Obviously it's something very bad.\n\nMCEVERS: There still are three other American hostages in North Korea. What do we know about them? What does this mean for the efforts to get them released?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, if the North Koreans are smart, they'll let them go as a gesture of contrition and goodwill after this disaster. They were visited by the American diplomat in North Korea when he went to get Otto. I suspect they're in - I won't say good condition, but at least they're there. I think the State Department would have a better feel for how they're doing. But you know, this is Americans held as bargaining chips. There's also a Canadian there that we should be concerned about.\n\nMCEVERS: You know, relationships between the U.S. and North Korea are already basically non-existent. Have you talked to the president about this, and what do you think the U.S.'s options are going forward?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, we have to be sending a very strong message that North Korea needs to have a suitable explanation. Secondly, we need to make sure that there's transparency on their part, maybe a human rights investigation by the U.N. But I wouldn't be opposed to putting more sanctions on North Korea. I don't think the military option makes any sense. I think eventually diplomacy must rule but not for now. I'm very sour and sad and angry right now.\n\nMCEVERS: It's a tough question to ask, but you know, at this time, some people are pointing fingers at one administration or another. Do you think that's useful at this time?\n\nRICHARDSON: It's not useful 'cause I worked with the Obama administration, and they were aware of this. The North Koreans were waiting for the new administration to come in. The Obama people tried. But the election happened, and the North Koreans wanted to probably deal with the Trump administration.

Well, here are MY issues with them (This pertains to a woman who had a kid and never married, or divorced her husband because \"She wasn't happy\". If she had a good marriage and he died, there might be wiggle room, but I still wouldn't date her).\n\n1: She decided to have a kid without a husband. This demonstrates terrible, selfish values. It also shows that she thinks of men as sperm donors and child support payers, NOT husbands & fathers. What will happen if you knock her up? Get ready to pay up for a kid that you won't get to be a real dad to.\n\n2: In some states, you can be responsible for child support by just living with her. I don't want to pay for kids that aren't mine. Do you?\n\n3: False allegations of child abuse. It isn't likely, but I don't want to take that chance. Getting branded with a big \"M\" on your forehead (For Molester) will WRECK YOUR LIFE. It will never go away. Too big a risk.\n\n4: Relationship aren't easy as it is.

The video, featuring muscled men alongside Jenek in and out of drag, presents a binary between what is expected of male beauty and feminine beauty, a conflict that Jenek has been wrestling with much of his young adult life.\n\n\"I struggled with my own masculinity, [and] even struggled with my own gender identity over the years,\" the RuPaul's Drag Race finalist confesses to The Advocate the day after Bianca Del Rio was crowned the season 6 champion. \"I felt really torn between my passion, which was doing drag, and wanting to have the right body and have the right look so I could be found sexually desirable.\"\n\nGender identity is a topic that Jenek discusses a lot, particularly in light of this season of RuPaul's Drag Race, in which the overlapping waters of the drag and transgender communities heated to a boil. This battle has largely been over the authority of the right to use words like \"tranny\" or \"shemale,\" which many trans activists consider slurs and some drag performers defend as endemic to drag pride and culture. As a result of this battle, Drag Race's network, Logo TV, not only apologized and pulled a controversial episode from its archives \u2014 in which contestants had to label close-up photographs as either \"female\" or \"shemale\" \u2014 but it also went a step further, vowing to remove a popular segment, \"You've Got Shemail,\" which was present from the show's inception, from all future seasons.\n\nThis act sparked even further resentment and eye-rolling among many past Drag Race fans and cast members. One of them, season 6 champion Bianca Del Rio, told The Advocate, \"It's not that serious. It's a drag show on Logo. We dress up. We pretend we're puppets. \u2026 Lighten the fuck up.\"\n\n\"I'm a Libra, so I see this from both sides,\" added Adore Delano, a Drag Race season 6 finalist alongside Del Rio and Act. \"In high school, I identified as transgender for years, so I personally find it interesting that it took [the transgender community] six years to get offended by that. But, I also see where they're coming from. I think BenDeLaCreme actually said this brilliantly. She said, 'There's so many words in the vocabulary. And if there's one word that you're using that could possibly offend someone, and really offend somebody, than why not just completely wipe it from your vocabulary and use something else.' I get that, but it's like, I see it from both ways. The show is so trans-friendly and so fun, and so campy, that it's like, there's no way you can take that out of context.\"\n\nFor Jenek, the debate also hits on issues close to home. His drag performance as Courtney Act, which so dazzled the Drag Race judges, had another effect on some fans in the past, who tried to convince Jenek that his convincing portrayal of a female meant that he must be a transgender woman. Jenek wasn't sure what to think. He remembers bursting into tears one night at the home of a friend because of his conflicted feelings about his gender identity.\n\n\"I was tormented, because I didn't know if I wanted to be a woman or if I wanted to be a man,\" he recalls.\n\nAs a result, the native Australian performer, who first rose to fame as a singer on Australian Idol only after slipping into Courtney Act's sequined gown, grew to resent his female persona. He would eschew weightlifting at the gym because he did not want to \"look too bulky for Courtney, and kind of blaming Courtney because of that.\"\n\nToday, Jenek no longer feels divided about his gender identity and has come to embrace both masculine and feminine sides. While he now identifies as a gay male, he views gender identity as more of a spectrum, in which he falls \"closer to the middle than most.\"\n\n\"The majority of people fall in the spectrum. And I think gender is like that as well,\" he says. \"I think we are born a certain sex, but we all express our gender in ways that is transgender.\"\n\nHis experiences have led him to seek out more information, sitting down with trans musician Our Lady J to talk about the issue on YouTube. Ultimately, he concluded that the problem wasn't that the topic wasn't serious, but rather, that the conversation between the drag and transgender community was stuck in place.\n\n\"I felt there was a lot of 'we're right, you're wrong,' pushing back and forth, different sides of the argument.

A 1973 legislative report on child care in the state said members heard testimony from children previously in Roloff's Rebekah Home for Girls about irregular meals and whippings. Roloff told lawmakers his homes should be exempted from state interference due to his religious roots.\n\n\"We spanked them because God loves them, and we love them,\" Roloff told the committee.\n\nThose hearings led to the Legislature passing Senate Bill 965 in 1975, which established child care licensing laws in the state.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nNow, 42 years later, Texas legislators are considering sharpening religious protections for faith-based groups the state hires to place children in foster and adoptive homes and oversee their care. Critics say this could give religious groups license to use their faith as a reason to refuse to place foster children with gay couples or with families with certain religious beliefs. Legislators say this could halt bipartisan warmth on bills changing how Texas cares for abused and neglected children.\n\nRep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls, vice chairman of the House Human Services Committee, has authored House Bill 3859, which would protect faith-based providers from retaliation if they assert their \"sincerely held religious beliefs\" while caring for abused and neglected children.\n\nThe bill would include allowing faith-based groups to deny a placement if it's against their religious beliefs; place a child in a religion-based school; deny referrals for abortion-related contraceptives, drugs or devices; and refuse to contract with other organizations that go against their religious beliefs.\n\n\nFrank said the his bill is meant to give \"reasonable accommodations\" for faith-based groups and not meant to be exclusionary. He said the ultimate goal is to help find the right home for kids.\n\nFaith-based organizations are closing their doors to foster children \"because they can't afford to stay in business when they're getting sued on stuff,\" Frank said. \"They're basically being told to conform or get out on stuff that's important but it's not core to taking care of foster homes.\"\n\nThe potential religious liberty fight comes as Texas legislators try to reimagine how to care for vulnerable children and entice more communities to open their homes to them. Part of that strategy includes convincing more faith communities to partner with the state. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hosted a Faith Leader Summit in November encouraging congregations to help, and Texas First Lady Cecilia Abbott in January publicly urged religious groups to support foster families with donations and other activities.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBut Jennifer Allmon, executive director for the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops, said that Catholic charities based in Texas are wary of continuing as child welfare providers without the protection that HB 3859 could offer. Allmon said some of the 13 such groups in Texas have faced lawsuits for not taking a young woman to get an abortion or not putting children in gay and lesbian households. For now, she said, the legislation's fate would be a \"critical factor\" in how Catholic Charities decides to move forward with the state.\n\n\"It's about recognizing the role of the faith-based provider and not extending beyond our role,\" Allmon said. \"We're asked to come forward and serve in this system because of our faith and our values and our mission.\"\n\nShe pointed out that Catholic charities in California, the District of Columbia, Illinois and Massachusetts closed their foster care services when lawmakers did not pass religious protections for them. Right now, some of the groups in Texas have suspended services temporarily to see what the Legislature does about added protections.\n\nChuck Smith, CEO of Equality Texas, an LGBT rights group, said he was scared of HB 3859 after watching similar legislation become law in Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota and Virginia. He said Frank's bill allows the possibility of children being denied services because of what a provider believes and that would not fly if it were any other state contractor.\n\n\"Any piece of legislation that would allow the personal or religious beliefs of a provider to override the best interest of the child is misplaced and I would suggest is a gross change in what religious liberty actually means,\" Smith said.\n\nIt's unclear if HB 3859 will make it to the House floor, but there are rumblings among legislators that it could be tacked onto another child welfare measure, House Bill 6, as an amendment. That bill, also by Frank, would overhaul the child welfare system by allowing more contracted organizations to monitor children in foster care.\n\nRep.

They ultimately decide to blow the horn from their dial boat to ward off any potential threats. Conis attends to the still injured Sanji and Usopp, while Pagaya silently hopes for everyone's safety in light of the perilous events that have gripped Sky Island. Throughout the forest, the ground is littered with all the Shandia and Enforcers of God's Army that have fallen over the course of the survival game, as they continue to wage war with one another. While the Shandia are still pushing to make it to the Giant Beanstalk, the Enforcers desperately regroup in order to repel them. Enel himself is enjoying the chaos, content that his prediction of the survival game is shaping up to come true.\n\nOn the beanstalk itself, the battle between Gan Fall, Zoro, Ohm, Wiper, and the Giant Snake continues to rage on. Wiper lands a direct hit to the snake with his Burn Bazooka, but is shocked that it is to no avail. The blow does still cause quite a bit of commotion inside the snake, sending Luffy toppling and causing him to wonder whats going on. Zoro grimaces in pain from a hit he took, as he rises to his feet. Ohm berates him for being a blue sea dweller that knows nothing, as he explains that his blade is actually the result of an iron cloud dial built into the hilt of the sword. It allows the blade to follow its target anywhere, which he then demonstrates by extending it all the way to Zoro from several meters away. Zoro blocks the attack with ease, commenting on the whip-like nature of the sword and how the warriors of the White Cloud Seas are like a bunch of circus performers.\n\nSensing new arrivals to the battlefield, Ohm tells Holy that they will now be splitting up. As predicted, both Shandia and God's Army Enforcers soon join them on the battlefield. The Shandia inform Wiper that they are the only ones left, and reaffirm their determination to help Wiper get to Enel. Inside the snake, Luffy decides to try to dig his way out, and begins clawing into the walls. In actuality he is tickling the snake, and the spectators are extremely confused to see the snake laughing hysterically.

As Nami asks Zoro where the others are, Wiper prepares a shot at Nami, wondering what she plans to do to Aisa. As he fires the blast, Gan Fall manages to get Nami and Aisa to safety aboard Pierre.

But what's less often considered is how these changes could also impact social mobility. A new report from UK charity Sutton Trust explains the danger, noting that unless governments take action, the next wave of automation will dramatically increase inequality within societies, further entrenching the divide between rich and poor.\n\nThe are a number of reasons for this, say the report's authors, including the ability of richer individuals to re-train for new jobs; the rising importance of \"soft skills\" like communication and confidence; and the reduction in the number of jobs used as \"stepping stones\" into professional industries.\n\n\"Traditionally, jobs like these have been a vehicle for social mobility.\"\n\nFor example, the demand for paralegals and similar professions is likely to be reduced over the coming years as artificial intelligence is trained to handle more administrative tasks. In the UK more than 350,000 paralegals, payroll managers, and bookkeepers could lose their jobs if automated systems can do the same work.\n\n\"Traditionally, jobs like these have been a vehicle for social mobility,\" Sutton Trust research manager Carl Cullinane tells The Verge. Cullinane says that for individuals who weren't able to attend university or get particular qualifications, semi-administrative jobs are often a way in to professional industries. \"But because they don't require more advanced skills they're likely to be vulnerable to automation,\" he says.\n\nSimilarly, as automation reduces the need for administrative skills, other attributes will become more sought after in the workplace. These include so-called \"soft skills\" like confidence, motivation, communication, and resilience. \"It's long established that private schools put a lot of effort into making sure their pupils have those sorts of skills,\" says Cullinane. \"And these will become even more important in a crowded labor market.\"\n\nRe-training for new jobs will also become a crucial skill, and it's individuals from wealthier backgrounds that are more able to do so, says the report. This can already be seen in the disparity in terms of post-graduate education, with individuals in the UK with working class or poorer backgrounds far less likely to re-train after university.\n\nThe report, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group and published this Wednesday, looks specifically at the UK, where it says some 15 million jobs are at risk of automation. But the Sutton Trust says its findings are also relevant to other developed nations, particularly the US, where social mobility is a major problem.\n\nSocial mobility is already a big problem in America\n\nOne study in 2016 found that America has become significantly less conducive to social mobility over the past few decades. \"It is increasingly the case that no matter what your educational background is, where you start has become increasingly important for where you end,\" one of the study's authors, Michael D. Carr, told The Atlantic last year. Another report found that around half of 30-year-olds in the US earn less than their parents at the same age, compared to the 1970s, when almost 90 percent earned more.\n\nIt's important to note, though, that there is disagreement about how bad the impact of automation on the job market will be. Some reports have suggested that up to 50 percent of jobs in developed countries are at risk, while others point out that only specific tasks will be automated \u2014 rather than whole professions. Economists also note that new categories of jobs are likely to be created, although exactly what, and how many, is impossible to accurately predict.\n\nThe Sutton Trust report also says that there is some reason to be optimistic about the coming wave of automation, particularly if governments can encourage people to train for STEM professions (those involving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).\n\n\"From a social mobility perspective there are two important things about the STEM sector,\" says Cullinane of the UK job market. \"Firstly, there doesn't seem to be a substantial gap in the income background of people taking STEM related subjects, and secondly, there isn't a resulting pay gap for those who come from different backgrounds. If the STEM sector is going to be the main source of growth over the medium to long term, that's a real opportunity to leverage social mobility there.\"", "greedy": "Most economists agree that advances in robotics and AI over the past few decades have made it possible for machines to do more and more of the work that humans once did.\n\nBut the question is whether the pace of automation will be as rapid as some economists predict.\n\n\"The pace of automation", "top-k": "Most economists agree that advances in robotics and AI over the past decade have made it possible to design more precise and robust robots, but the technology is still in its early days.\n\n\"We are still in early days when it comes to robotics, so the field is still in its infancy,\" said", "beam": "Most economists agree that advances in robotics and AI over the past few decades have made it possible for machines to outperform humans in a wide range of tasks.\n\nBut there are also concerns about the impact of these advances on jobs and the economy.\n\nIn a new report, the Center for", "greedy_mauve": 0.9822561813322865, "top-k_mauve": 0.9873265118243013, "beam_mauve": 0.9819341465810134}, {"id": 255052, "ended": true, "length": 142, "text": "/d\u0292u\u00b7m\u0259/\n\nJuma is a farm-to-fork food truck operating in Victoria, B.C. bringing to life global flavours from local produce.

Special Operations officials last year spoke publicly about using a drone called the Coyote\u2014the wings of the Coyote unfold as the drone launches from a six-inch-wide tube. A higher-endurance version is in development.\n\nWeapons are getting smarter and drones are getting smaller, and pretty soon it will be hard to tell the difference. \"The main weakness of sUAS [small unmanned aircraft systems] is range,\" says U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Alexus Grynkewich, deputy director for operations at the National Joint Operations and Intelligence Center and coauthor of a recently released Pentagon study called \"Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan.\" \"You need some delivery method to get them close.\"\n\nGrynkewich sees the engineering challenge as a series of trade-offs. A heavier engine increases a drone's range, but the airplane that launches it isn't able to carry as many. The amount of sophistication on the sensor adds expense to the drone, which may be lost in battle. And the wingspan is limited by the hardware on the airplane. Despite these complexities, the Air Force sees smart but disposable aircraft as an important solution: Airpower is a game of threat and response. One side makes a powerful radar array, the other creates stealth warplanes that can fly undetected. By the time the new airplane is ready to meet the old threat, a new one has emerged. It's a lot easier, cheaper, and faster, however, to redesign a drone than an entire airplane. \"The idea is to have a tech refresh fielded in months instead of years,\" says Reid Melville, strategy lead for unmanned systems at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. \"That way, when we get surprised, we will have the infrastructure in place to make a rapid change.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nExcept when it comes to singing The Righteous Brothers songs in bars, this new generation of drones promises to be the perfect wingman.

Hidden air-defense systems shoot at MALD and expose themselves to counterattack. After a stutter-step start, the technology caught up with the idea and in 2009 Raytheon delivered the first MALD to the Air Force. Recent upgrades include a carbon-composite fuselage that lightens the airframe. An upcoming datalink ability will enable pilots to reprogram MALD's flight path after launch.\n\n\u2022Status: Currently deployed.\n\nRyan Inzana\n\nCoyote\n\n\u2022Dropped from an airplane, these disposable drones are launched from a six-inch tube and unfold in flight.

But they both went offline by September 2013, making Japan completely nuclear-free for about two years.\n\nThe country has ushered in stricter safety regulations to avoid a repeat of the accident, including more backup prevention measures and higher tsunami-blocking walls in some areas.\n\n\"It is important to restart reactors one by one from the perspective of energy security, the economy and measures against global warming, but safety always comes first,\" Industry Minister Yoichi Miyazawa told reporters.\n\nIf another atomic accident happened, he added, the government would \"deal with it responsibly\".\n\nBeefed-up safety measures are key to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's bid to get some of about four dozen reactors back up and running, as Tokyo's energy policy sets its sights on nuclear accounting for as much as 22 percent of Japan's energy needs by 2030.\n\nPower companies that own them are also keen for more restarts, fed up with having to make up lost generating capacity with pricey fossil fuels.\n\nJapan's post-Fukushima energy bill skyrocketed as it scrambled to fill the gap left by taking reactors offline, pushing the country into successive trade deficits.\n\nThose expenses were exacerbated by a sharp weakening of the yen, which pushed up costs for energy imports paid for in other currencies, particularly the US dollar.\n\nSeveral other reactors have received a safety green light from officials, but battle lines have been drawn with many local communities strongly opposed to restarts.\n\nTakashi Kato, professor emeritus at Tokyo's Seikei University, was critical of Tuesday's restart, saying Abe's close business ties were trumping safety concerns.\n\n\"Abe is not listening to the voice of the people -- he is acting as if he has been given a blank cheque,\" Kato said.\n\n\"It is big business demanding a stable supply of power by resuming nuclear reactors, not the general public.\"\n\nSafety officials have stressed that any switched-on reactor would operate under much tighter regulations than those that existed before Fukushima, the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\n\"A disaster like that at Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant will not occur,\" under the new rules, Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) chairman Shunichi Tanaka said in an interview with the Nikkei newspaper published at the weekend.\n\nBut Tanaka conceded there was \"no such thing as absolute safety\", and Japan's people are sceptical as the country remains deeply scarred by the legacy of Fukushima.\n\nShort link:", "greedy": "Japan on Tuesday ended a two-year nuclear shutdown in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, but the government said it would not be able to meet its obligations to the international community.\n\nThe government said it would not be able to meet its obligations to the international community because it had not been able", "top-k": "Japan on Tuesday ended a two-year nuclear shutdown in the country, a decision that comes as North Korea has ramped up a nuclear warhead program.\n\n\"Today, the country that has been shut out of the global economy can resume its normal operations,\" said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.", "beam": "Japan on Tuesday ended a two-year nuclear shutdown in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.\n\nJapan's nuclear regulator, the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), said on Tuesday that it had approved the restart of two reactors at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in northern", "greedy_mauve": 0.8775305577656317, "top-k_mauve": 0.9427743552518817, "beam_mauve": 0.9245494423810154}, {"id": 255057, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "In a country where racial classifications create social hierarchies that assert the superiority of white skin and Caucasian features, and the inferiority of \"black\" skin and Asian features, interracial and interethnic couples in Lebanon are abhorred, stigmatized and socially ostracised.\n\n\"I'm a stranger in my own country,\" Saeb Kayali, a Thai-Lebanese, told Al-Akhbar.\n\n\"Demeaning gestures, head-shaking, stares, and under-the-breath comments are the most passive of the reactions we get in public,\" \"I remember once a woman asked my friend, who happened to be right next to me, if I spoke Arabic,\" Kayali said, \"And I always get questions like 'Where are you from?

People of African or Asian heritage are automatically associated with allegedly 'inferior' domestic workers by virtue of their phenotype, and their identity is accordingly erased and replaced by an array of racist stereotypes.\n\n\"At first we didn't even hold hands in public. Then I asked him how is it okay for others to express hatred but not for us to express love?\" Pi added, \"now we act like any endogamous couple and if someone is disturbed he or she can simply look away.\"\n\n\"His family didn't speak to him for five years,\" Pi said, \"they didn't even know me, but my Filipina features were more than enough reason for them to disapprove of our marriage.\"\n\nAccording to Rana Boukarim, spokeswoman for the Anti Racism Movement in Lebanon, \"Many families eventually come to accept the interracial marriages, which may be seen as a decrease in racism. However, when questioned, these family members, who were initially against the idea, often say 'but she is different from other Filipinas'.\"\n\nMoreover, couples who are driven by love to cross the color line face socially-constructed derision because they, and their mixed-race children, provoke the invisible yet existing laws of racial segregation.\n\n\"They used to call me Oreo\"\n\n\"I remember one time, light-skinned Lebanese students refused to sit next to an Afro-Lebanese kid because they thought his dark skin color was 'contagious' and they feared they would turn black.\" Mixed-race children face blatant racism at school as their fellow classmates fail to censor their speech. While interracial couples are mentally and psychologically aware of notions of race and the difficulties that might be ahead in ethnically homogenous communities, their children are not.\n\n\"Back in preschool, kids used to call me 'blacky' or 'Oreo' as if my skin color is my name and identity,\" Walid Yassine, a 22-year-old Congolese-Lebanese told Al-Akhbar.\n\n\"I was called 'the Chinese kid',\" Kayali said, \"even though I'm not half Chinese to begin with.\"\n\nThrust into a world of racial stereotyping, mixed-race children experience disparities in self-esteem, self-degradation, and identity-related struggles.

This is still true, as Kennen can very easily scale thanks to the lack of kill pressure that tanks generally have.\n\nWith the new midseason patch and attempt to shift kill pressure away from tanks once more, Kennen has continued to be a staple pick in the top lane against top lane champions just hoping to get out of the lane phase without a huge disadvantage. Kennen is a great bully and an even better scaling champion, letting his splitpush plan come to fruition and carry the game alone, if given enough room.\n\nRunes\n\n1 Attack Speed and 8 Attack Damage Reds, Armor Yellows, 3 Attack Speed and 6 Magic Resistance Blues, Attack Speed Quintessences\n\nThis rune page gives you a good balance of resistances, attack damage, and attack speed. Because of Kennen's W passive, he's more inclined to specialize in attack speed earlier, and more attack speed increases his sustain through Doran's Blade as well as his initial Blade of the Ruined King buy, making his dueling much better in the early and mid game stages.\n\nMasteries\n\nEighteen in Ferocity is pretty standard for auto attacking threats. Kennen has great synergy with Fervor of battle in particular, as the attack damage contributes to his W passive, which will give him greater burst damage as he builds up the empowered auto attack. Fresh Blood and Battle Trance help with laning without a downside, and Kennen needs the armor penetration over the magic penetration for his Blade of the Ruined King damage onto tanks despite his tendency to do slightly more magic damage (thanks to creeps having low magic resistance) over the course of the game.\n\nTwelve in Resolve keeps Kennen alive and allows him to threaten the splitpush much more often thanks to the use of Insight. Insight should be taken over Fearless because Kennen already gets a good chunk of resistances in fights through his E, making more resistance suboptimal versus having health to balance it out. As well, having Flash and Teleport up more often allows Kennen to make cross-map plays and use the utility of flash to escape sticky splitpush or teamfight situations. Veteran Scars and Tough Skin help optimize his early resistances and contributes to a brutal laning phase for the opponent as trading becomes more and more fruitless.\n\nSkill Order\n\nFirst six levels: QEWWWR\n\nGetting Q first is the best harass tool, and E afterwards helps escape any early cheese from the top laner or jungler. After, however, W is the skill you want to max. It helps with waveclear in conjunction with E, and actually scales with your total attack damage, increasing by level. This is AD Kennen's primary tool for dueling as it provides huge burst in lane in combination with an active W.\n\nAfter that, maxing E second helps with waveclear and gives you access to your escape much more often, making your splitpush a lot safer. Your ultimate should be leveled when possible, and your Q should be leveled last despite its early point as a harass tool.\n\nBuild Order\n\nThough Doran's Shield got a huge buff, it's still not a great choice for champions hoping to bully their lane as Kennen would. Rushing Blade of the Ruined King is a must, even though it got its cost very very slightly increased. After that, going Frozen Mallet will ensure that you will have the survivability and kiting ability to deal with any tank or fighter hoping to contest your presence in a side lane. Phantom Dancer adds to your attack speed and continues to help your survivability for a very low cost. Death's Dance got an insane buff in Patch 7.9 that helps Kennen's dueling substantially, and contributes to his W passive more than any other AD item given it having 80 attack damage. Guardian Angel helps as well, as it also now gives attack damage.\n\nDoran's Blade + Health Potion Blade of the Ruined King Mercury Treads Frozen Mallet Phantom Dancer Death's Dance Guardian Angel Maw of Malmortius or Runaan's Hurricane\n\nPlaystyle\n\nEarly game, Kennen's ranged advantage lends itself well to a favorable laning phase because he can easily harass and cs simultaneously. That combined with his good base damage on abilities allows him to trade against the patterns of most meta top laners. Kennen is fairly gankable, so make sure you're not pushing in. If you are, your ultimate is a good get out of jail free card as it will stun pursuers as you scurry away.

Just fine or the best thing since sliced bread?\n\nPhoto: Vladimir Pustovit, Flickr\n\nResponding cheerily \"ich bin gut\" to the question \"wie geht's?\" (\"how are you?\") could make you seem rather arrogant as opposed to conveying that you are well.\n\nDeclaring \"ich bin gut\" indicates that you are morally upstanding, highly skilled, and a shining star all round, whereas \"mir geht's gut\" means the rather more modest \"I'm fine\".\n\nYep, it's another case of remembering that reflexive pronoun. Ah grammar, how we love you.\n\n4. Cross the road or crucify the road?\n\nPhoto: Thomas Szynkiewicz, Flickr\n\nAlthough \"das Kreuz\" means \"a cross\", using the verb \"kreuzigen\" to refer to crossing the street is a big no-no: you'll inadvertently be saying that you want to crucify the road.\n\nGet the correct verb down in your vocab book - it's \"\u00fcberqueren\".\n\n5. Tasty or laughable?\n\nPhoto: Anastasia Liem, Flickr\n\nEven the best of intentions can sometimes go awry. Eagerly telling your Austrian hosts at dinner, \"Das Essen ist l\u00e4cherlich!\", will not have the desired effect.\n\nInstead of expressing gratitude for such a delicious meal, you will instead be saying that the food is laughable or even ridiculous.\n\nInsulting your hosts will not win you any brownie points, so to avoid getting off on the wrong foot with them, choose the adjective \"lecker\" instead - you'll charm them in no time.\n\n6. Friend or girlfriend?\n\nPhoto: Brett Sayer, Flickr\n\nLinguistically, the lines between purely platonic friendships and romantic relationships can often be blurred in German, as the word \"Freund\" can signify either a friend or a boyfriend.\n\nIf you want to escape the minefield of accidentally implying romantic interest when there is none whatsoever, use \"ein Freund von mir\" instead.\n\n7. Mist or dung?\n\nPhoto: Pimthida, Flickr\n\nIt's a grey and miserable morning, and swathes of mist greet you as you walk out of your door.\n\nExclaiming \"es gibt so viel Mist!\" will not convey that there is a great cloud of mist stifling the air, but rather that there is a lot of dung strewn about, so it's best to avoid this word unless you're on a farm.\n\nBut in spoken German, \"Mist\" has another meaning - it's a swearword that you'll hear people on the railway station platform muttering angrily when they miss their train. When you start swearing in German, that's when you know you've moved well and truly past the novice stage and become a true local.\n\n8. Gift or poison?\n\nPhoto: Andrew Kuznetsov, Flickr\n\nWant to make a good first impression?\n\nEnthusiastically offering your host family a \"Gift\" upon arriving in Austria is definitely the wrong way to go about it, as this false friend means \"poison\".\n\nIn your eagerness to be polite and to express your gratitude, you'll be offering them a present which is worlds apart from the tea and chocolate they expected.\n\nIf you'd rather not muck up the very first encounter you have in Austria, use the word \"das Geschenk\" instead.\n\n9.

Brown is now serving a life without parole sentence.\n\nIt's the second case the high court has tossed in recent months involving the Shaken Baby Syndrome. Since 2000, at least 11 Mississippians have been convicted in such cases with two of them sitting on death row.\n\nOne of them is Jeffrey Havard, who was convicted in 2002 after Hayne told jurors the death of 6-month-old Chloe Britt was a homicide and that her injuries were consistent with her being shaken to death \u2014 a claim he now doubts.\n\n\"This case does fundamentally recognize if you don't have an expert, your hands are tied,\" said Havard's lawyer, Graham Carner of Jackson. \"The science has changed.\"\n\nFor decades, Shaken Baby Syndrome was widely accepted, diagnosed through a triad of symptoms: subdural bleeding (blood collecting between the brain and the skull), retinal bleeding (bleeding in the back of the eye) and brain swelling.\n\nIn the years since, medical belief that these symptoms provided iron-clad proof of homicide has begun to crumble with several studies raising doubts.\n\nIn 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the syndrome diagnosis be replaced with \"abusive head trauma.\"\n\nHayne told The Clarion-Ledger earlier this year that there was \"growing evidence\" his shaken baby diagnosis in the Havard case was \"probably not correct\" because shaking alone isn't able to generate enough force to cause such injuries.\n\nLike Brown, Havard sought funds for an expert in his case.\n\n\"This case is a trend nationwide and in Mississippi with Shaken Baby Syndrome being placed under the microscope,\" Carner said. \"The question is how do you handle forensic science in shaken baby cases?\"\n\nLast week, the state Supreme Court threw out Brown's 2006 conviction in Coahoma County because the judge failed to provide him funds to hire an expert.\n\nLawyers for the state of Mississippi had argued Brown was too late to challenge the Shaken Baby Syndrome because he failed to bring it up at trial.\n\nJustices disagreed, saying Brown \"is arguing that the Shaken Baby Syndrome theory is invalid, and he argues he simply had no way to challenge that theory without his own expert.\"\n\nIn 2002, Brown and Shirley Myles married and had a son, Le'Anthony, who was born six weeks' premature.\n\nOn March 28, 2003, Myles gave their 6-month-old son a bottle containing milk and cereal at 1:25 p.m. before returning to work.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, she testified she got a call from Brown, telling her to return home because Le'Anthony had choked on some milk, was having trouble breathing, and they needed to take him to the emergency room.\n\nA helicopter arrived at the Clarksdale hospital at 5:40 p.m. to transport the baby by helicopter to University of Mississippi Medical Center. A minute after taking off, the child went into cardiac arrest and died.\n\nHospital personnel let Brown hold Le'Anthony. Myles came in later and held him, too.\n\nHayne conducted the autopsy, concluding the death was a homicide, and police questioned Brown.\n\n\"I don't know what happened,\" he told them. \"I know I didn't do nothing to him. I didn't harm him in no kind of way \u2014 no kind of way at all. When they come up with this shaken, I don't know. The only thing I know, I did not harm him.\"\n\nWhen detectives told Brown his story didn't \"match up\" with what happened to Le'Anthony, he replied that he didn't care what they said, he did not harm his son.\n\nThe police handcuffed Brown and took him to jail. He was unable to attend his son's funeral.\n\nWith the help of family and friends, he finally posted $75,000 bond and was able to hire a lawyer.\n\nBut he said he still couldn't afford to hire an expert pathologist to examine the autopsy.\n\nProsecutors called the defense's request a \"fishing expedition,\" and the judge denied it.\n\nAt trial, the emergency room physician said she did not notice any bruises, abrasions, scars or anything else abnormal.\n\nMyles testified she never saw any evidence of abuse or Brown \"getting rough\" with Le'Anthony.\n\nHayne told jurors the child's death was a homicide and that it \"would take the violent shaking of a child to produce these types of injuries.\"", "greedy": "LeeVester Brown The state Supreme Court has ordered a new trial for a man who was convicted of killing his wife and her friend in a 2007 shooting.\n\nThe court ruled that the trial judge erred in allowing the prosecution to introduce evidence that Brown had a history of mental illness.\n\n", "top-k": "LeeVester Brown The state Supreme Court has ordered a new trial for an 18-year-old accused of raping an 8- and 10-year-old.

V.), where the Greek text has \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b2\u03b4\u03ad\u03bb\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2. The Greek itself, however, is referable to a Hebrew expression, , found in Dan. ix. 27 (where the \u05dd of has been added, through a copyist's error, from the \u05de of the ensuing word); in Dan. xi. 31, and in Dan. xii. 11 (with omission of the prefixed \u05de).\n\nThe context of these passages leaves no room for doubt as to what was intended by this somewhat odd expression; namely, the transformation, by Antiochus Epiphanes, of the sacred Temple at Jerusalem into a heathen one. In both Biblical and rabbinical Hebrew abomination is a familiar term for an idol (I Kings, xi. 5; II Kings, xxiii. 13; Sifra, \u1e32edoshim, beginning, and Mekilta, Mishpatim, xx. ed. Weiss, 107), and therefore may well have the same application in Daniel, which should accordingly be rendered, in agreement with Ezra, ix. 3, 4, \"motionless abomination\" or, also, \"appalling abomination.\" The suggestion of many scholars-Hoffmann, Nestle, Bevan, and others\u2014that , as a designation for Jupiter is simply an intentional perversion of his usual appellation \"Baal Shamem\" ( , \"lord of heaven\") is quite plausible, as is attested by the perversion of \"Beelzebub\" into \"\u0392\u03b5\u03b5\u03bb\u03b6\u03b5\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\" (Greek version) in Mark, iii. 22, as well as the express injunction found in Tosef., 'Ab. Zarah, vi. (vii) and Babli 'Ab. Zarah, 46a, that the names of idols may be pronounced only in a distorted or abbreviated form (see the examples quoted there). Though the expression \"Abomination of Desolation\" is accordingly recognizedin the light of this interpretation as a mistranslation of the phrase used in Daniel, there is no doubt that in the circles directly influenced by the Book of Daniel\u2014the same circles that originated the apocalyptic literature\u2014the expression was employed to designate an important eschatological conception. For it is only in an eschatological sense that the expression can be adequately explained in the New Testament passages above mentioned.\n\nAccording to most modern commentators, these passages are a Jewish apocalypse, somewhat tinged with Christianity, intended to prophesy the end of time, when the Antichrist, as the Abomination of Desolation, shall be enthroned as a ruler in God's Temple. The closely related \"smaller Apocalypse\" in II Thess. ii. 1-12 is a conclusive justification of this view; for it shows that neither the Romans (as Weiss in his commentary, ad loc., holds), nor the Zealots (Bleek, \"Synoptische Erkl\u00e4rung,\" and others), nor Caligula with his self-deification (Spitta, in his \"Offenbarung Johannis\") can be intended.\n\nThe rabbis as a whole consider that the expression refers to the desecration of the Temple by the erection of a Zeus statue in its sacred precincts by Antiochus Epiphanes (see Apostemos ). Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to Manasseh, who, as related in II Chron. xxxiii. 7, set up \"a carved image . . . in the house of God\" (Yer. Ta'anit, iv. 68a, and Rashi on the passage in Babli, ibid. 28b). The Haggadah narrates that two statues were erected, one of which fell over upon the other and broke off its hand. Upon the severed hand the following inscription was found engraved: \"I sought to destroy God's house, but Thou didst lend Thy hand to its protection\" (Ta'anit, 28b et seq.; compare Rabbinovicz, \"Vari\u00e6 Lectiones,\" on the passage for variant readings).\n\nBibliography: Compare modern commentators\u2014Meinhold, Bevan, Weiss, Prince\u2014upon the passages in Daniel and Matthew;\n\nalso Bousset, Der Antichrist, English translation, 1896, especially index;\n\nSpitta, Offenbarung Johannis, pp. 493-497;\n\nGr\u00e4tz, Gesch. d.

REUTERS/Osman Orsal\n\nCan Dundar, editor-in-chief of the Cumhuriyet newspaper, and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul are accused of trying to topple the government with the publication last May of a video purporting to show Turkey's state intelligence agency helping to ferry weapons into Syria by truck in 2014.\n\nTheir case has brought international condemnation and raised concerns about freedom of expression in Turkey. At their first hearing a week ago, the court took the case behind closed doors and accepted Erdogan as a complainant in what critics said was a move that undermined judicial independence.\n\n\"During the legal process, the president personally intervened, both as a complainant and through his repeated public statements. Turkey's judicial system is not strong enough to shrug off the dominance of this president,\" Muharrem Ozay, a lawyer for the two journalists, told Reuters.\n\nErdogan has cast the newspaper's coverage as part of an attempt to undermine Turkey's global standing and has vowed that Dundar will \"pay a heavy price\".\n\nHe has acknowledged that the trucks, which were stopped by gendarmerie and police officers en route to the Syrian border, belonged to the MIT intelligence agency and said they were carrying aid to Turkmens in Syria. Turkmen fighters are battling both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.\n\nAli Seker, one of more than a dozen opposition members of parliament outside the court room, said he and his colleagues were trying to exercise their legal right to observe the case and were concerned that Gul and Dundar might be re-arrested.\n\nThe court on Friday rejected the opposition applications, lawyers said. Supporters chanted \"You cannot silence the free press\" and \"Shoulder to shoulder against fascism\".\n\nThe two journalists spent 92 days in jail, almost half of it in solitary confinement, before the constitutional court ruled last month that pre-trial detention was unfounded because the charges stemmed from their journalism and they were released.\n\nErdogan said he did not respect that ruling.\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONCERN\n\nThe trial comes as Turkey tries to deflect criticism from the European Union, United States and rights groups that say it is bridling a once-vibrant press.\n\nThere were ugly scenes in Washington on Thursday, where Erdogan is on a visit, as his bodyguards tried to stop protesters chanting and waving banners outside the Brookings Institution think-tank where he was speaking.\n\n\"Turkey's leader and his security team are guests in the United States,\" said Thomas Burr, president of the National Press Club. \"They have no right to lay their hands on reporters or protesters or anyone else for that matter ...

And it's within this single step that lessons are learned, directions are given, and mistakes have already been made a thousand times over. It is in fact this single step that provides us with an opportunity to learn from all those who came before us and to lay down the seeds of personal evolution and change. Learning from another's experience could be the most important factor towards achieving any kind of success in life. [details] (by Adam Sicinski) Be careful when comparing yourself to others. You know everything about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your successes, and your failures. All you know about others is what they've chosen to show, and that would usually be only their success. List everything good about yourself and say, \"Hey, I have a good personal r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Look at all I have achieved and what I can learn and achieve.\" You can then go out feeling good and prepared for whatever challenge the world presents for you.

Each day write on a blank piece of paper 'I am grateful for\u2026' then write down as many things that you are grateful for. Believe me, you will realize how lucky you really are. Date each sheet, and when you aren't feeling all that crash hot, look back over what you have written and it will certainly boost your spirits! (by Viki Slough) Persist until it pays off.

These large turbochargers were used to feed high-performance engines and generate significant power. The problem would come when you called upon that power. Your right foot mashes the gas\u2014then nothing. A shock of power would eventually make its way to the drive wheels, sometimes mid-corner. Turbo lag is notoriously finicky (and in the case of old race cars, a killer) and automakers have been working on ways to reduce or eliminate it. Volvo has its own solution and it involves a bit of engineering that we need explained.\n\nThe system is called Power Pulse, and it works with the help of an air compressor and an electric motor. The motor waits for the driver to ask for more power, and it keeps the air compressor tank ready to go with clean air pulled in from the intake. When the throttle is pressed, the air tank can then force compressed air into the exhaust manifold and send it along with the exhaust gases to spool up the turbo.\n\nThis is almost similar to what the Fast and Furious crew would be doing when they hit their \"nitrous\" button. They want to force more air into the engine, and here Volvo is forcing more air into the exhaust manifold to get the turbo up to speed more quickly. There's no need for bottles of NOS though, as the air compressor seems suited to handle the task.\n\nOnce the turbo has spooled up, the air compressor's job is done. Now the electric motor refills the tank so the Power Pulse system is ready to help out the next time it's needed.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFollow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.", "greedy": "Follow Jeff Add to circle Turbo lag is a defining feature of the game.

(The Washington Post)\n\nAUSTIN \u2014 It had been billed as a \"March Against Sharia\" \u2014 one of many protests across the country against the feared subjugation, somehow, of Americans under Islam.\n\nBut the few dozen sharia protesters who stood at the gates of the Texas statehouse didn't manage to march anywhere. They had failed to secure the permits for that.\n\nAnd as they shouted warnings against the supposed dangers of Muslim religious codes \u2014 which are practiced privately by a tiny fraction of the U.S. population \u2014 the demonstrators were drowned out by a much larger group of counterprotesters who mocked and harangued them for hours on Saturday.\n\nAbout 50 gathered at the Texas Capitol for an \"anti-sharia law\" rally, and around 300 came out to counterprotest. Riot police are out now. Posted by The Texas Observer on Saturday, June 10, 2017\n\nLike simultaneous events in other U.S. cities, the protest was organized by ACT for America \u2014 which claims to defend against a conspiracy of Muslim organizations and sympathizers trying to enforce sharia law within U.S. borders.\n\nBut Austin organizer Lauren Morris insisted the event did not target Muslims, but merely religious laws derived from the Koran and traditions of the Islamic faith.\n\n\"It brutalizes them and robs them of their dignity, and it will not take hold in the West,\" she said.\n\n[Anti-sharia demonstrators hold rallies in cities across the country]\n\nIn a somewhat confusing video advertising the Austin protest, Morris said she had been visited by Iranian students as a child. She described the horrors of female genital mutilation and said she had herself survived a \"horrific cutting event.\"\n\nMorris was supposed to make a speech in Austin. But this didn't happen either, as counterprotesters shouted her group down for most of the event's four-hour duration.\n\nInstead, the anti-sharia protesters spent much of the day surrounded by a thick band of state police, separating them from a much larger crowd of detractors.\n\nSome of the counterprotesters were self-described \"antifascists,\" who had mobilized to disrupt the event as soon as they heard about it.\n\nOthers were simply people who came to say their piece.\n\nInside the police line, a man held a sign: \"I Don't Take Orders From Mohammed.\"\n\n\"What's racist about any of this?\" the man asked those screaming at him from the other side of the police line, as seen in video from the Texas Observer.\n\n\"Oh my God. Everything!\" a woman replied.\n\nThey yelled back and forth for a while. A woman with the anti-sharia group boasted of her rights to walk around without covering her head in the United States \u2014 unless she wanted to, which she did that day, with a \"Make America Great Again\" hat.\n\nA counterprotester listed the many evils and subjugations done in the course of American history.\n\n\"Do you know what the f\u2014 has happened on this land?\" she yelled. \"How the f\u2014 do you think your people got into power?

Unfortunately, Linux has few defenses against performance interference in shared resources such as processor caches and memory buses, so applications in a cloud can experience unpredictable performance caused by other program's behavior,\" the researchers write.\n\n\"Our solution, CPI2, uses cycles-per-instruction (CPI) data obtained by hardware performance counters to identify problems, select the likely perpetrators, and then optionally throttle them so that the victims can return to their expected behavior. It automatically learns normal and anomalous behaviors by aggregating data from multiple tasks in the same job.\"\n\nIn essence, CPI2 lets Google engineers isolate poor performance down to a single task running on a single processor within a cluster of thousands, then drill down to it and select to throttle that task, without causing a CPU overhead of more than 0.1 per cent. It requires no special hardware and its only software dependency appears to be use of Linux.\n\nCPI2 lets Google gather information on the expected CPU cycles-per-instruction (CPI) of any particular task, build standard resource profiles from this data, and then use these profiles to help the web giant identify tasks that are taking more cycles-per-instruction than usual to get executed (\"victims\") and the tasks that may be causing this disruption (\"antagonists\"). Software agents can then throttle the antagonists so the victims stop fretting and get back to work (Sounds a bit rough\u2013Ed).\n\nThe \"vast majority\" of Google's machines run multiple tasks, the company wrote. These jobs are either latency-sensitive or batch-based, and are themselves typically composed of multiple tasks. 96 per cent of the tasks running on Google servers are part of a job with at least 10 tasks, and 87 per cent of the tasks are part of a job with 100 or more tasks.\n\nBut these tasks can interfere with each other through foul-ups relating to processor caches and memory allocation problems, causing the latency of a task within an application to skyrocket \u2013 something that ad-slinger Google wants to avoid at all costs.\n\nTo help it control latency spikes on each processor on a task-by-task basis, Google has rolled out CPI monitoring across all of its production servers. It derives its CPI data by measuring processor hardware counters, according to CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.REF divided by INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED .\n\nGoogle gathers this data for a 10 second period once every minute via a perf_event tool in counting mode, rather than sampling mode. Total CPU overhead of the system is less than 0.1% and leads to no visible latency impact.\n\nDon't worry 'victim', the agents will save you!\n\nCPI is calculated to take account of variances in the type of CPU being run on, Google said, as typical clusters will run across a large range of platforms. CPI values are measured and analyzed locally by an agent that runs on every machine (pictured). This agent is always given the most current expected CPI distribution for the jobs it is running tasks for, so that it can spot aberrations without having to phone home.\n\nIf this agent spots a \"victim\" task that is being slowed, it looks once per second for the \"antagonist\" tasks disrupting it. It uses an algorithm to do this that lets it work out whether there's a relationship between an antagonist's increasing use of CPU and a \"victim\" task spiking, in terms of the cycles needed per instruction.\n\nIf it identifies an antagonist and finds that it is a batch job, then the system will \"forcibly reduce the antagonist's CPU usage by applying CPU hard-capping\".\n\nIt is more than likely that this agent is given tasks from a component of Google's mega-infrastructure-management system named Omega, especially when you consider that the architect of Omega (computer science luminary John Wilkes) also happens to be one of the co-authors of the CPI2 paper.\n\nThe CPI2 system can even automatically throttle disruptive tasks, but only if they have been marked as being eligible for what the search giant terms \"hard-capping\" \u2013 something that not many tasks are tagged as. Alternately, system operators can interface with CPI and can manually hard-cap suspects.\n\nCPI data is logged and stored offline, along with profiles of antagonist tasks, so admins can query it via Google's major internal analysis tool, Dremel (of which", "greedy": "Google has wired its worldwide fleet of servers up with the latest in networking technology, and it's now ready to take on the world's largest cloud providers.\n\nThe company has announced that it will be rolling out a new version of its Google Cloud Platform that will allow it to offer a more flexible", "top-k": "Google has wired its worldwide fleet of servers up with the latest technology.

And sometimes there's the teenager near the Bank of Ireland on the quay with a cup in his hand. Yesterday they had disappeared.\n\nThe city's small Roma community is living in fear, say its members, and are afraid to show their faces in public.\n\nAlmost 200 people gathered in Waterford city last Saturday evening outside the home of a large Roma family \u2013 including toddlers and children \u2013 and staged a protest in which windows were smashed and doors broken down. Some Roma families had to be evacuated from their homes and are now living at undisclosed addresses.\n\nThe following night a smaller group also protested and kicked at the doors of a building they believed housed members of the Roma community.\n\nIt was the culmination of tension which has been building for some time \u2013 most of it whipped up over social media \u2013 over street begging and crime in the city. Numerous Facebook pages have appeared over recent months, labelling members of the Roma community as scum and threatening to \"burn the cockroaches out\". Most have since been taken down, only to be replaced with new pages.\n\nA counter-demonstration in the city last night, organised by Waterford Against Racism, called for calm and opposed any attempt to tackle local problems through vigilantism. About 100 people gathered on a drizzly night in John Roberts Square, against the backdrop of a heavy Garda presence.\n\n\"Yes ,there is crime in Waterford and yes, there is crime in the Roma community,\" Seamus O'Brien, a member of Waterford Against Racism, told the gathering. \"But there's also crime in my family and yours. We can't allow ourselves to descend to mob rule and racist commentary on social media to solve this. We need to say 'no' to racism, and 'yes' to ending poverty.\"\n\nHe said the Garda superintendent had told local politicians and representatives that the vast majority of crime in the city had nothing to do with the Roma community.\n\n'People are very, very scared'\n\nStelian Ciuciu, of the Roma Integration Association, said many members of the community had little choice but to beg, and pleaded for greater understanding. \"People are very, very scared . . . These are people who are not educated. They do not get social welfare, many of them. This is what they know. People need to understand this,\" he said.\n\nFew elected representatives from the major political parties were present at the gathering, although all parties have strongly criticised last weekend's trouble.\n\nAcross the city in Manor Street, residents who agreed to be interviewed had mixed feelings over the local disturbances at the weekend.\n\nNone defended the attacks on the local homes; and they claimed local criminal elements were involved in the intimidation of the Roma. But many felt issues involving crime and begging needed to be addressed by the Garda.\n\n\"I pride myself on not being a racist,\" said Bernard Cleary (39). \"I try not to label people. But there are issues that need to be addressed. But the begging is an issue and I know people who've been victims of crime involving the community.\"\n\nAnother man in his 60s \u2013 a former Waterford Crystal worker \u2013 said the begging was tarnishing the image of the city at a time when it was trying to attract tourists.\n\n\"A lot of people are sick of it. We're doing our best to attract these people. If it keeps up, they just won't come any more.\"\n\nThe attacks at the weekend have also taken on a political edge, with some politicians privately blaming others of stoking up anger.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in councillor John Hearne, who has taken a strong stance against crime in the city, has previously highlighted crime involving some foreign elements. But yesterday he insisted any targeting of the Roma community was reprehensible.\n\nMost in the city agreed the actions of just 200 people last weekend did not represent the view of the vast majority of the city's 50,000 residents.\n\n\"Begging is a problem,\" said local resident Dermot Keyes. \"The problem here is we don't have enough garda\u00ed to tackle street crime.

Hogmanay is supposed to be for families \u2013 that's the tradition \u2013 and instead we'll have something which has nothing to do with real celebration.\"\n\nShe says that on a practical note it's also \"the one night in the year\" when many men help out, as in organising family parties \u2013 and predicts many football supporting spouses will be otherwise occupied.\n\nShe also considers the licensed trade will struggle to contain the backlash from the game, whatever its result, and that even pubs closing early will face an extra security hazard as they strive to maintain their legal obligation by turning away aggressive drunks.\n\nA main worry is that many supporters will be both belligerent and drunk before trying to gain entry to licensed premises \u2013 dissuading normal Hogmanay revellers from having a drink \"before the bells\" .\n\nThat in turn could give bars the worst of both worlds, with few regular customers braving late night streets for it to be worthwhile opening, and a deluge of drunk supporters to keep at bay.\n\nThe propensity for domestic violence is feared set to rise dramatically.\n\nAnother worry is that as embattled police try to contain \"Old Firm\" -related drunkenness, abuse and sometimes outright thuggery the chaos could leave the way open for opportunist criminals.\n\nMeanwhile Hogmanay, often said to have lost its traditional family and community spirit, could send out a message about Scotland wildly at odds with its supposed theme of inclusion, generosity and hope.\n\nA night when \"auld acquaintance\" is supposedly celebrated in a roseate familial and communitarian glow of Burnsian bonhomie could instead feature in January 1 news broadcasts as a squalid sectarian bacchanale which puts families at risk, mocking the \"Glasgow Loves Hogmanay\" theme which the city council hoped would move celebrations away from the usual Glasgow-style mass drunkenness.\n\nThe police have said that planning for the unprecedented December 31 \"Old Firm\" fixture is already underway, and that policing it will involve \"a multi-agency partnership approach\".\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins has defended the remarkable decision by maintaining that the time and date were decided after discussions involving police, football authorities and broadcasters.\n\nChief Constable Phil Gormley said: \"There is no ideal time to have the game, but if you put it on New Year's Eve at 12.30pm you reduce the risk of over-consumption of alcohol.\n\n\"You've also got a full transport infrastructure on so that people can get to and from the match.\n\n\"There's a compelling logic around it.\"", "greedy": "Licensed trade operators in and around Glasgow have united to oppose the plans.\n\nThe Scottish Government has said it will not be able to meet the \u00a31.5bn cost of the scheme, which would see the construction of a new bridge across the Clyde.\n\nThe Scottish Government has said", "top-k": "Licensed trade operators in and around Glasgow have united to support the campaign for a new Glasgow City Centre.\n\nThey want the Glasgow City Centre to be the world's best centre for trade.

Modern ayurvedacharayas, homoeopaths and other Ayush doctors may soon be allowed to conduct non-invasive abortions. The health ministry has worked out changes to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Amendment Bill. The revised bill proposes to allow Ayush doctors to conduct non-invasive procedures on women seeking to terminate pregnancy. The draft bill will soon be sent to the Cabinet.\n\n\"We have made revisions to the earlier draft and proposed that Ayush doctors who are registered healthcare specialists be allowed to carry out non-invasive procedure, which would mean prescribing medicines etc,\" a senior health ministry official told TOI.\n\nAnother key amendment seeks to increase the period for abortion to 24 weeks from the present 20 weeks. The government's proposal, originally formulated taking a cue from a study conducted by Population Council, is aimed at increasing access to safe abortion by expanding the number of healthcare providers. Estimates show around 7 million abortions are conducted in India every year and over 50% of them are said to be illegal.\n\nInitially, the government had decided to allow midwives and Ayush doctors to do even invasive procedures for abortion, but dropped it following mounting objections from allopathic practitioners, particularly Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). IMA, a pan India voluntary organization with a membership of 2.5 lakh allopathic practitioners, said even the latest move can put patients at risk as well as allow unethical practices and sex selective abortions.\n\nTOI\n\nDon't Miss 40.7 K SHARES 16.5 K SHARES 9.9 K SHARES 9.4 K SHARES 3.9 K SHARES\n\n\"MTP is a procedure meant to be conducted by an allopathic doctor only. It is not possible to allow restricted practice. How will the government monitor whether a person is conducting abortion through medicine or doing invasive procedures,\" says IMA secretary general Dr KK Aggarwal. According to Dr Aggarwal, abortions by a non-MBBS doctor can lead to critical medical conditions arising out of excessive bleeding or incomplete abortions, which can be difficult to handle.\n\nMinistry officials say FOGSI members were part of the consultations and initially supported the amendments. However, FOGSI has maintained that it changed its position after a thorough discussion. \"Expanding the number and type of providers able to legally perform abortion services, including manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) and medical abortion (MA), could greatly expand women's access to safe abortion and save many lives each year,\" Population Council said in a note on the issue.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also seems to endorse the government's proposal.

The agent, along with Massachusetts state troopers Joel Gagne and Curtis Cinelli, had been questioning Todashev about an unsolved triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts, in which someone slit the throats of three drug dealers.\n\nThe murder took place on the 10th anniversary of 9/11; the killers had lain their victims with heads turned to one side, and dumped a pound and a half of marijuana on two of the bodies, leaving $5,000 at the scene of the crime. The victims were Raphael Teken, Erik Weissman, and Tsarnaev's friend and sparring partner Brendan Mess. Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxing champion, trained at the same gym with both Mess and Todahsev, an MMA fighter.\n\nTodashev was said to be midway through writing out a confession that implicated himself and the elder bombing suspect when something went wrong.\n\nAccording to the officers in the room, Todashev hit McFarlane on the head with a coffee table and then proceeded to charge Cinelli with a metal broomstick. Gagne was outside at the time, making calls to the Middlesex district attorney. McFarlane shot Todashev seven times in two bursts, including once in the top of the head and three times in the back. Todashev was allegedly on the ground preparing to lunge, when McFarlane shot the second time. Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice and Florida State Attorney Jeffery Ashton cleared McFarlane of any wrongdoing, arguing he shot in self-defense.\n\nHassan Shibly, the director of the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is filing the \"notice of claim\" on behalf of Todashev's family today. Under the Federal Torts Claims Act they must submit this document to the FBI before they can formally sue. In the claim they cite McFarlane's checkered past as a police officer in Oakland, California; the bureau's negligence in hiring him; and the undue pressure placed on Todashev as well as his friends and family after the marathon bombings.\n\nMcFarlane was the subject of two police brutality lawsuits and four internal affairs investigations. He pleaded the fifth during one of the most high-profile trials against Oakland police when officers were charged with beating, kidnapping, and planting false evidence. The department settled out of court. McFarlane was still receiving a pension from the Oakland police department when he shot Todashev.\n\n\"The FBI was negligent in hiring McFarlane,\" lawyers acting for Todashev's parents argue in the claim. They also criticize the Department of Justice for not having a \"disinterested investigator\" question McFarlane about the shooting. The FBI has been scrutinized for their internal investigations, after a New York Times report found that the agency cleared every single agent in more than 150 investigations into shootings or deaths since 1993. McFarlane declined requests to be interviewed by the state attorney who conducted an independent investigation.\n\nNowhere in the claim is it denied that Todashev attacked an agent; his parents say law enforcement officers breached a duty to keep their son safe by interviewing him in his home, and leaving him alone with only one agent and one officer in the room. According to Ashton's report, the agent, the troopers, and a Joint Terrorism Task Force officer, originally agreed to keep four members of law enforcement in the room at all times. They also argue that threatening Todashev's friends to become informants or face immigration problems caused him to act out and led him to \"falsely confessing to crimes he did not commit.\"\n\n\"I want justice first and foremost,\" Todashev's father, Abdul-Baki Todashev, told the Daily Beast from Moscow. \"I never thought that things like this happen outside of the movies. I never realized law enforcement could ever do this, walk in and shoot somebody. I want to shine some light on this situation.\"\n\nAgents began to question Todashev about his relationship to Tsarnaev on April 21, 2013, shortly after the Tsarnaev brothers were identified as the suspects in the Boston Marathon attacks. Todashev's girlfriend, Tatiana Gruzdeva, and his friend Ashurmamad Miraliev, say they were asked to become FBI informants before they were detained and deported.

(AP Photo/Mic Smith)\n\nIn the battle over Wall Street regulatory bona fides, Hillary Clinton is often at a disadvantage. She has accepted donations from Wall Street donors, and Sanders has not.\n\nBut at the Democratic debate in Charleston Sunday night, Clinton unearthed a part of Sanders' record on Wall Street regulations that seems -- at least at the outset -- to complicate his claim of being a crusader for more, rather than less regulation.\n\nSpecifically, she noted that Sanders voted in favor of The Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000.\n\n\"Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O'Malley's phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08,\" Clinton said.\n\nAnd she's right. But here's what she didn't say: Not only did President Bill Clinton sign that bill into law, but key officials in his administration were also credited with helping to craft it.\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation, as part of their \"Read the Bill\" effort to demystify the legislative process explained it this way:\n\nLeading the charge in Congress were Sens. Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Rep. Thomas Ewing (R-IL). In May of 2000, Rep. Ewing introduced his Commodity Futures Modernization Act. While Ewing's bill sailed quickly through the House, it stalled in the Senate, as Sen. Gramm desired stricter deregulatory language be inserted into the bill. Gramm opposed any language that could provide the SEC or the CFTC with any hope of authority in regulating or oversight of financial derivatives and swaps. Gramm's opposition held the bill in limbo until Congress went into recess for the 2000 election. Throughout the better part of the year Gramm, Lugar and Ewing worked with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets\u2014most specifically, Treasury Secretary [Larry] Summers, CFTC Chairman [William[ Rainer and SEC Chairman [Arthur] Levitt\u2014to strike a deal on the bill.\n\nThe final version of the bill included stronger deregulatory language, but it isn't clear whether many lawmakers knew that it was in there. (This was around the time that the country was embroiled in a contentious presidential vote recount in Florida.)\n\nThe CFMA made its way through Congress on the back of a must-pass, 11,000-page bill to fund the government that year. This is where Sanders comes in, he joined a majority of Democrats and Republicans in approving the omnibus bill, which was signed into law by Bill Clinton.\n\nBill Clinton has since said that he regrets that decision.", "greedy": "Democratic presidential candidate, Sen.

How many times have you heard the story about the simple shepherds in the field watching over their flocks at night, and suddenly in a starlit sky there comes the angel and the heavenly host proclaiming good news to all of humanity, and the shepherds go and follow the directions of the angels and they find Mary and Joseph and the baby Jesus lying in the straw surrounded by the silent, innocent benediction of the animals in the stable?

Steven Charleston (TEC)\n\nWas there ever a moment in church when you were listening to a lesson being read and about halfway through it you suddenly wished you could call a time out, say to the reader, \"Stop! Hold on! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Back up and start that story again. I need to hear that again. Something didn't quite sound right to me.\" Read full transcript...\n\nOther Recent Content by The Rt. Rev.

That's nearly two-thirds of young adults who qualify for Obamacare marketplace coverage in the 34 states.\n\nAn additional one million young adults will also now qualify for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare's expansion of the program. All told, the report finds that 40 percent of the 7.2 million young, uninsured adults living in the 34 states will be able to get coverage for $100 per month or less thanks to the health law. That works out to be 2.9 million people.\n\nIf all of the 34 states had chosen to expand Medicaid, however, that number would actually spike to 6.2 million people. That's because many young adults earn little enough money to qualify for the program under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier independent studies have found that families who qualify for Obamacare's subsidies will get an average annual credit of $5,548 per year to help pay for insurance under the law. That would cover a full 66 percent of these families' health premiums. A September report by HHS also found that 6.4 million Americans across all ages can get insurance through Obamacare's marketplaces for less than $100 per month.\n\nThose figures provide a contrast with recent reports that the health law is driving up individual policy premiums and even causing consumers to get cancellation notices from insurers. These stories tend to ignore the reality that many of these plans allure customers with deceptively low monthly premiums, but offer skimpy benefits, fail to cover out-of-pocket costs, and come loaded with high deductibles that are of little help in the case of a medical emergency.

When she plays, she reminds us of why we play. With every touch of the ball, she exudes joy and happiness. Farrelly is truly an unsung hero\u2014staying humble, she doesn't say much, but her feet certainly do the talking.\n\nYet last December, at the age of 27, due to injuries she sustained from a car crash, Farrelly announced she was giving up the sport that had brought her so much joy.\n\nThe accident took place over a year earlier in September 2015. Farrelly was driving when another car came speeding around the corner, skidded into her lane and hit her straight on the driver's side. The head-on collision deployed both airbags and totaled Farrelly's car, forcing her to climb through the back of the vehicle to get out.\n\n[More from Excelle Sports: After the Whistle Blows: Learning to love life when you're forced to say goodbye to your sport]\n\n\"The accident was crazy because, at the time, I had no idea of the impact it would have on my future and my life,\" Farrelly told me. \"At the time of the accident, I declined treatment from the ambulance\u2014I just wanted to go home. In all honesty, I kind of regret not taking help from the paramedics. My instinct has always been to just pretend to be OK. That's what we learn as athletes and professionals\u2014to push through it. That pain is weakness. I was hurting and I was too proud to admit it.\"\n\nWhen she retired, Farrelly was on Seattle Reign FC's roster, although she had yet to play with the team. The year before, she had been on the Boston Breakers' roster but had sat out the 2016 season with neck and back injuries from the crash. Eight months later, she learned she had also suffered a concussion.\n\n\"All of a sudden, I just wasn't the person I had been for 25 years,\" she said of the effects of the concussion. \"I felt so, so alone. Every moment was masked in this layer of fog that I could not seem to break through. I had no energy. I was depressed. I started distancing myself from everyone who loved me.\"\n\nSuddenly, Farrelly, who started playing soccer professionally for the Women's Professional League in 2011 after a decorated career at University of Virginia, found herself in a dark place.\n\n\"My time since the accident has been the most difficult time of my life,\" she said. \"Aside from losing my health and career, I was forced to face all of my demons. When I tell you that every single thing from my past came crashing down on me, I mean every single thing: family issues, sexual assault, abuse, a long history of an eating disorder \u2026 All of it. I felt like I was facing the wreckage without any clue of who I was. I felt like I had absolutely nothing.\"\n\nThe situation became unbearable and deeply overwhelming, especially immediately after the accident. Farrelly says she couldn't sleep or read, suffered terrible migraines and was even unable to walk or run. Facing what seemed like insurmountable challenges, she felt beyond hopeless in her own skin.\n\n[More from Excelle Sports: Sinead Farrelly retires from pro soccer, one year after car accident]\n\n\"I did not want to live anymore. I would wake up in the morning so panicked because it felt too heavy to have to go through an entire day all over again,\" she said.\n\nThe accident turned out to also be a catalyst for Farrelly to question her real identity. The sport had been her fulcrum up to that point. She struggled, as many players do, to reconcile who she would be without soccer. Last December, she announced her retirement on Facebook.\n\n\"Soccer was my outlet when times were hard,\" Farrelly wrote on her page of the decision. \"It was a place I felt safe, yet it continued to push me past my comfort zone day after day. Losing soccer for me was losing my identity. And with the loss of that came the loss of everything.\"\n\nWhile Farrelly tried to come back to soccer, she knew she had to listen to her body. She knew she needed to rest, recover from her injuries and from her post-concussion symptoms.\n\n\"I had no desire to retire any time soon,\" she said. \"It still makes me really sad I had to go out the way I did.", "greedy": "This is the third installment of Rachel Breton's column, \"After the Storm.\"\n\nThe first installment, \"The Storm,\" was published on June 1.\n\nThe second installment, \"The Storm 2.0,\" was published on June 8.\n\nThe third installment, \"The", "top-k": "This is the third installment of Rachel Breton's column, \"After the Storm.\"\n\nThe latest storm in Houston is the second to hit the area this month.

It seemed the thing to do.\n\n\"I want to start off with an apology for something I feel like I, and the SCA, have done a poor job of. We've done a poor job of introducing me and an incredibly poor job of reaching out to opinion leaders in the atheist movement. Undoubtedly, the behind-closed-doors decision to make what was bound to be a controversial hiring decision should have been tempered by a more comprehensive and immediate introduction and explanation of why I, of all people, was chosen for this position.\n\nI have identified as a non-theist for a long time, but I am very new to this movement. This is not because I don't care about the issues you care about, I very much do, but they have not been my focus and, because of that, I really didn't realize how bad things were until recently. My career and my focus have been very issue centered, some of these issues overlapped with my own secular beliefs, but the fact is that issue-focused work tends to create a very insular worldview. So, in many ways, I am a recent convert, not to your beliefs, but to your cause.\n\nWhich is where I have made another mistake. This community is very engaged and very well-informed and I have done my best to educate myself quickly, but there are things I have missed on the way. My recollection of statistics about Republicans from 20 years ago, for example, is not really the best gauge of Republicans now. Sometimes I forget that that was an entire generation ago, it doesn't seem that long to me. And I have to admit that my claims that the majority of Republicans are pro-choice, OK with gay rights, and for the separation of church and state were as much a result of wishful thinking as they were of ignorance. I have had statistics shown to me that do indeed prove I was dead wrong on this front.\n\nAnd I need your help on this front. I am trying, but I just am not as well-educated about this as those people who have focused on this cause their whole lives. I know the goals of the coalition and am well-versed in those goals and don't doubt my ability to execute them, but as for the wider culture of the secular movement and the less specific goals thereof, I will need more time to learn the nuances, and I hope you will help me rather than condemning me for my neophyte status.\n\nMy final big mistake is that I've been trying to focus exclusively on my positives without acknowledging my negatives and without engaging with them openly and honestly. This is a fault of being in politics, it makes you quite the bullshit artist. I should have known better in this community than to think I could dance around questions without being called on it. So let me say that you are right. You are right that I've worked for and support a party that disagrees, in majority but not in totality, with many of your goals. But I was working for causes that I cared very deeply about, and I will not apologize for doing that. And I will not abandon my party because other people have taken it in a direction I disagree with. It is better for all of us if we can bring the party back in line with the goals of the secular community and I really do think that is possible.\n\nSo, just to recap, I haven't done a good enough job introducing myself, I haven't had the time to educate myself as thoroughly as the community is educated, and I have not been clear on acknowledging that there were some negatives to my background. That said, I think I bring a lot to the table that I hope you can appreciate.\n\nI am an experienced lobbyist and I know the workings of DC very well. I have led coalitions in the past and had great success. Although my work with Republicans is difficult for many of you to accept, it gives me an in to people who might not otherwise be as interested in hearing what we have to say. And I am legitimately, passionately interested in promoting this cause.

The officer claimed he was \"dragged\" by DuBose's vehicle following an altercation during a routine traffic stop, and was therefore forced to open fire, shooting DuBose once in the head.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tensing was indicted for murder after Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph Deters said body-camera footage, which he released at a press conference announcing the charge, showed the officer was not dragged during the encounter.\n\n\"It is our belief that he was not dragged.

But at five minutes and 44 seconds into the video, he states: \"I think I'm OK. He was just dragging me.\"\n\nTo which a second officer, who stands out of the frame, replies: \"Yeah, I saw that.\"\n\nTensing continues: \"I thought I was going to get run over. I was trying to stop him.\"\n\nThen, at six minutes and 54 seconds into the footage, while Tensing is seemingly conversing with the same officer, he states: \"He was dragging me, man.\"\n\nThe officer replies, \"Yeah.\" To which Tensing continues: \"I got my hand and my arm caught inside.\" The officer then replies, \"Yeah, I saw that.\"\n\nThe identity of this officer is not immediately clear. A copy of the University of Cincinnati police division's information report on the shooting names university police officer Phillip Kidd as a witness to the entire event.\n\nThe information report, written by UC police officer Eric Weibel, states: \"Officer Kidd told me that he witnessed the Honda Accord [DuBose's vehicle] drag Officer Tensing, and that he witnessed Officer Tensing fire a single shot.\"\n\nWeibel's report continues: \"Looking at Officer Tensing's uniform, I could see that the back of his pants and shirt looked as if it had been dragged over a rough surface.\"\n\nAbout 14 minutes into the video, while Tensing is still at the site of the shooting, but has now moved further away from DuBose's crashed car, he is instructed by a third officer to indicate where the altercation had started.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prosecutor announces charges against officer for Samuel DuBose shooting.

We also chose our favorite 5\" touchscreen then paired it with a small USB powered driver board through our 50pin to 40pin + AR1100 Adapter. The screen itself is commonly seen in consumer electronics such as miniature TVs, GPSs, handheld games, car displays, etc. It comes with a 40-pin connector that has eight red, eight green, and eight blue parallel pins for 24-bit color capability.\n\nThe driver board only has an HDMI input but for Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black and other computers. HDMI is the best quality output available so you'll get a great looking display. The display is very easy to use - simply connect the USB power cable to 5V power supply that can provide 500mA, then connect a digital video source to one of the HDMI port. Voila, a display! To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI output. We also noted it does not work with a Raspberry Pi + Windows 10 IOT yet.\n\nThe touchscreen controller shows up as a plain 'HID Mouse' device - and we do the touch screen calibration step here so you can plug and play. Works with any computer, just plug a mini B cable from the touch adapter to the computer USB port. If you want to calibrate it again, Microchip has Windows-only calibration software. For Linux users, check out xinput_calibrator which is the general-use X11 calibration software.\n\nThere's a little wired PCB with little buttons that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast. It tries to auto-detect which input you have and switches to that one or you can 'select' from the menu keypad which to display.\n\n\nFor use with a Raspberry Pi we suggest editing config.txt to set the HDMI to 800x480 in case it doesn't detect the resolution properly. You can see our suggested config.txt in the Technical details tab. The easiest way to edit the config.txt is to put the Pi SD card into an every day computer and edit config.txt with any text editor and save. For use with a Beagle Bone Black, we found it works when plugged in, no configuration required.\n\n\nWe show the TFT above on a wire stand, which is not included.

I am born and raised in Ontario, Canada and no, you don't get used to the winters, at least I haven't yet in my thirty something winters here!\n\n\nI have always had a magnetic pull towards creative endeavors. My earliest activities were drawing, sculpting (horrendously) and painting whatever I could. At the age of 6 or 7 I decided that my father was completely wasting his tool shed with such nonsense as lawnmowers and gardening tools, and took it upon myself to take over and make it my painting studio.\n\n\nLet me tell you, it was hot as hell in that little wooden shed at the back of our yard, but I was determined to make my art and my dad didn't complain, in fact he was my very first customer, and still has the misshapen, heat stroke induced portrait of our family dog somewhere.\n\n\nI went to school for photography, and while that is still a major passion and hobby for me, I quickly realized that I didn't have the drive or will to deal with the horrors of wedding photography and the like, and that my resting bitch face wasn't helping the situation any.\n\n\nI spent a lot of years making my art for friends and family, or mostly just for my own amusement. I toyed with the idea of selling on Etsy for YEARS. Once I began to create things for my shop I found that I could not stop. The ideas are streaming in almost constantly and I have since branched out into soaps, bath products etc, which was a whole new art form for me and something that I am finding to be immensely satisfying. Soap making is like art and science rolled into one and the possibility for creation is endless!\n\n\nAnother passion I picked up in the last couple years has been Pyrography or \"wood burning\" and it quickly became not only an obsession, but the most sought after art I have ever created!\n\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that creating and expanding my artistic horizons will only continue on and on, thus my little shop has become something of a \"general store\" featuring plenty of different items and products, and as much as online advice tells us to stick to one item per store, this works for me and I love the variety!\n\n\nI hope you will enjoy scrolling through and will come back often if only to see what this mad girls mind has concocted next!\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJen", "greedy": "A little about me My name is Jen or \"Jennifer\" I'm a 27 year old woman who has been a professional photographer for over 10 years.

Sometimes they are relatively easy and reward well enough that they become popular. Other times it takes significant effort and planning just to get through an STF, and those queues get ignored by most of the community.\n\nOne thing is for sure, a queues popularity will change over time, as do the techniques used to get through them. The best example is \"I've got Kang!\" has evolved from being a job you took out of necessity, to something that's little more than a speedbump in the race to complete a CSA in under 30 seconds.\n\nThe new missions have their fair share of confusion at the moment that's impacting not only the normals but advanced and elite queues as well. I've had greater success with runs set up privately through Redditchat or the various DPS channels \u2013 but at the same time, I've also watched Elites fail in the first 30 seconds with a highly-skilled team, just because someone pushed a Battleship to close to the Starbase with a mistimed tractor beam repulsor.\n\nOne last point before the briefing: these techniques represent the efforts of many players, and while they worked for us, they may not be the only way to beat this STF. If you've come across other methods, don't hesitate to share them in the comments below.\n\nMission Brief: The Tzenkethi Front\n\nRegardless of the difficulty (normal, advanced and elite), the mission parameters remain essentially the same. A Tzenkethi invasion force has moved five small staging bases into the Eta Serpentis system, and are launching waves of attacks against the planet's defences (Klingon Starbase).\n\nYour goal is to intercept the Tzenkethi Battleships \u2013 marked by the Protomatter Bomb warning sign on your main viewscreen. In the process of destroying the battleship, you recover the Protomatter Bomb and then use it against one of the five Tzenkethi staging bases.\n\nThe STF comes with voice prompts and reminders, letting you know when a player has picked up the bomb, and when a base is destroyed. When you pick up the bomb, your ship will be given a visual cue identifying that you have the bomb. If you are destroyed, the protomatter bomb you carry is destroyed with you.\n\nThe Football (Protomatter Bomb)\n\nWhile in Tzenkethi hands, the protomatter bombs are targeted at your station. They can be deployed fairly close to the station, and the bomb itself cannot be intercepted by weapons or space magic. At about a 2km range, a Battleship can easily deploy the device and hit your station. (It's instantaneous) For Normal and Advanced runs, the optional objective is to prevent damage to the station for additional marks. For Elite runs, failure to stop this attack on your station is an auto failure.\n\nWhen the football is in a players hands, your ship becomes impacted by the bizarre effects of protomatter. The first thing you will notice is that your ship is unable to go to full impulse, and you appear to be covered in a type of exotic radiation. This becomes problematic as you try to get to the Tzenkethi bases quickly.\n\nWarning: If you use a teleport ability like Trajector Jump you will drop the bomb and a Tzenkethi group will immediately warp in and claim the bomb. (TY ElectrumLeopard)\n\nAdditionally \u2013 if you carry the bomb with a Romulan ship, do not use the singularity jump or you will lose the bomb; same thing with the singularity shadows. (TY Nandos)\n\nSome players will experience a visual glitch in that the bomb may appear to 'drop' along the way. This appears to be a coding problem in the game, or if you prefer, a false image caused by temporal distortion (a QA happy accident). As long as you have the main marker showing you have the bomb, it will not release until you are in range when you are offered an interaction button to drop the bomb. Deploying the bomb takes a short amount of time, and if you're taking damage, the bomb will not drop. A second visual glitch appears to happen when you switch alts and make multiple runs \u2013 occasionally the bomb identification will not show. There is no easy fix other than restarting the game after you complete the mission.\n\nThe Tzenkethi\n\nThe Tzenkethi battle groups operate in waves. You will encounter groups of frigates on an ongoing basis, while the bomb groups consisting of a battleship, and a cruiser to provide support.

Sum up all of who you are \u2014 your aspirations, perspective, strengths, intellect, personality, all of it \u2014 in one page, single spaced.\n\nHit the panic button.\n\nYou know what I do when faced with a problem? I ask the Internet. So do a Google search \u2014 I dare you \u2014 for the phrase \"admissions essay advice\" and see the mess you get.\n\nOne list on a prominent Web site includes the following suggestions (in order, with some paraphrasing): be cautious and then, immediately afterward, be controversial.\n\nO.K. Got it: Say something risky without taking chances. That's not helpful.\n\nNeither is the advice you get from most admissions officers when you ask them.\n\n\"Just be yourself,\" they say. Is there an alternative to that? Were you supposed to lie and pretend to be your smarter and more interesting older brother?\n\n\nHere are your deceptively complicated essay goals, as I see them:\n\nShow us how you think.\n\nTell us what matters to you.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat this: That is a really difficult task. It demands that you understand yourself in a way that perhaps no one has ever asked of you. It demands that you ask yourself questions perhaps no teacher has ever asked. Questions like:\n\nWhat invigorates/inspires/angers me?\n\nWhat do I wish we talked or learned about in school?\n\nWhat are my most strongly held opinions and where do they come from?\n\nWhat are the differences between how I see myself and how others see me?\n\nWhat pieces of my life transform my thinking (whether I want them to or not)?\n\nWhat ideas fire me up just when everyone else is cooling down?\n\nThese aren't easy questions. They are dangerous questions. They are questions with teeth, questions that require you to stake out a position, to have an opinion and to express something of substance.\n\nYou don't need to literally answer one of those questions to write a good admissions essay (though you could); think of the list as a set of examples.\n\nBeing honest and forceful about yourself may make some adults around you nervous; it's not \"safe.\" They will worry that you are being too controversial or informal. You should listen carefully and try to see your writing from their perspective. But you should feel comfortable ignoring advice that does not feel right.\n\nIf you are not interested in thinking about the big issues (or the small ones) around community service, here is some radical advice: Don't write about it.\n\nIf you love your sport, but it isn't what you are itching to talk about when you get out of bed, don't write about it.\n\nWriting about service or determination reflects important qualities, but no one in our applicant pools writes about how quickly they quit or how much they hate helping society. If you write the \"safe\" essay, how will you stand apart?\n\nI wrote of your goals, now here is ours: to build the most interesting and intellectually diverse class we can. We want to fill our seats with students who have things to say, who will challenge conventions and advance conversations, who will learn from each other.\n\nThe answers to those dangerous questions define who you are. They reflect what you value and how you think, as well as how you will enhance our community and classrooms.

The waiver had meant that Puerto Rico had the option of importing food, fuel and supplies more quickly, and for half the cost, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.\n\nWith the 1920 law back in effect, the island is now required to pay much higher costs to import supplies. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That's meant that Puerto Rico pays double the costs to import goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands \u2015 and that U.S. vessels are making bank.\n\nThe return to higher shipping costs won't help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation. Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don't have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago. Just 15 percent have electricity. Many people still haven't heard from loved ones, and at least 39 deaths have been attributed to the storm.\n\nLapan said DHS is \"always prepared to review requests on a case-by-case basis and respond quickly\" to possible waivers of the Jones Act. But those decisions have to be related to national defense, he said, and are not driven by cost-related matters.\n\n\"We believe that extending the waiver is unnecessary to support the humanitarian relief efforts on the island,\" Lapan said. \"There is an ample supply of Jones Act-qualified vessels to ensure that cargo is able to reach Puerto Rico.\"\n\nMario Tama via Getty Images Maria Chiclano, who has no running water or power in her home, washes clothes with her sons in the Espiritu Santo river during heavy rains, more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico.\n\nDespite DHS' position, Puerto Rico Gov.

He eventually caved to pressure from lawmakers including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nMcCain has been pushing to get rid of the Jones Act altogether. It costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and he recently introduced legislation to nix the law.\n\n\"Now that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law,\" McCain said in a statement to HuffPost. \"Until we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria.\"", "greedy": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired at midnight, and the island's government is now scrambling to find a way to pay for the island's massive debt.\n\nThe Jones Act, which requires ships to be registered in the U.S., was originally passed in 1920 to protect American", "top-k": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Monday, meaning no more cargo ships will be able to pass through, a major blow to Puerto Rico's economy.

Led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the study was published in Nature.\n\nWe already knew that Venus has a weird super-rotation, where its winds can rotate 60 times faster than the planet. But it seems that on the night side, this process is even more chaotic than on the day side.\n\n\"This study challenges our current understanding of climate modelling and, specifically, the super-rotation, which is a key phenomenon seen at Venus,\" said H\u00e5kan Svedhem, ESA Project Scientist for Venus Express, in a statement.\n\nThe team found that night-side clouds form large, irregular patterns, dominated by waves that appear to stand still in the atmosphere, called stationary waves. In January of this year, a huge stationary wave was seen on Venus by the Akatsuki spacecraft, stretching for more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles).\n\nIn this study, the scientists used data from the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) to study the night side, using infrared to study the clouds. They found they did not move with the atmosphere, an unexpected discovery that was later confirmed by Akatsuki.\n\nStationary waves are thought to form over mountains or other high-elevation regions. Weirdly though, in this data stationary waves were missing in the intermediate and lower cloud levels, up to about 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the surface.\n\n\"We expected to find these waves in the lower levels because we see them in the upper levels, and we thought that they rose up through the cloud from the surface,\" co-author Ricardo Hueso of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain, in the statement. \"It's an unexpected result for sure, and we'll all need to revisit our models of Venus to explore its meaning.\"\n\nAkatsuki is continuing to orbit Venus, so it may be able to shed some light on some of the weird things going on with the planet.\n\nWN.com, Jim Berrie", "greedy": "For the first time, scientists have studied clouds and wind patterns in the atmosphere to understand how they affect the climate.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface is affected by the amount of cloud cover.\n\nThe study", "top-k": "For the first time, scientists have studied clouds and wind in detail using data obtained during a satellite mission.

I'm going to first outline how to create it from scratch, then explain how to just update mine with your data (less work involved this way).\n\n\nCreating the Full Viz\n\nStep 1: Get the Data in Your Desired Format\n\nStep 2: Creating the Top 5 Chart\n\n1 Star Rating:\n\n\n2 Star Rating:\n\n\n3 Star Rating:\n\n\n4 Star Rating:\n\n\n5 Star Rating:\n\n\nPosition of 1/2 Star:\n\n\nPosition of 1/4 Star:\n\n\nPosition of 3/4 Star:\n\n\nIndex:\n\n\nStep 3: Creating the Breweries Map\n\nStep 4: Creating the Breweries Table\n\nStep 5: Putting It All Together on a Dashboard\n\nUpdating My Viz with Your Own Data\n\nI mentioned in my original post how I got the data, but I'll go ahead and explain it again. On Untappd's Website , you are able to become a \"Supporter\". Once you do that, you get access to all of your data in an .xls or .csv format. Please note that it costs $5 to become a supporter. Also, if you don't cancel your subscription, they will charge you that $5 every month. So, I just paid the $5, downloaded my data, then canceled my subscription so I don't get charged again. Once you download the data, go ahead and open it up in Excel.Once you have the data opened up, you will see there are fields for the Brewery State and Brewery City. What we need to do is copy both of those and paste them into this Batch Geocode Website so we can create our Brewery Map later. You could try to just use the Brewery State and City to map in Tableau, but a lot of times, Tableau either won't recognize the city, or it will come back as an ambiguous location. So, just paste the city and state into the box on that website, choose Batch Geocode Output Options to be only Latitude and Longitude, then click Geocode. This may take a little while (its best to do about 100 at a time), but it will eventually spit out all of the Latitudes and Longitudes. Then, create two new columns in your spreadsheet and paste the values into there. You will have to use Text-to-Columns with a comma delimiter to split these out. Then you will be good to go ahead and load the data up into Tableau.The only manipulation I did of the data once inside Tableau was a little bit of grouping for the Beer Type field. Untappd uses a lot of different beer types and I just wanted to group some of the similar ones up, so I wasn't stuck with 100 different groups. An example of this is combining all of the different IPA sytles into one over-arching category: IPA. This step is completely optional, but I think it looks much nicer only having 15-20 different groups when looking at the Style filter on the visualization.Doing this is pretty easy. Just drag out the Beer Type field, then Ctrl-Click multiple styles you think would be grouped well together. Once you have multiple types selected, right click and choose \"Group\". You can see an example photo to the right. Then, you can right click your new group and choose \"Edit Alias\" to rename your group. Do this to all the styles you feel necessary to group. I used this website as reference.This is probably the toughest part of this whole visualization. This is primarily because of using the stars to signify ranking. Thinking about it, you need not only a full star image, but you also need fractions of that star (1/2 of a star, 3/4 of a star, etc.) I learned how to do this by downloading this workbook . They did a really great job of getting this star rating system to work correctly in Tableau. So, to do this, you are going to need 9 calculated fields:Next, we are going to right-click our index measure and choose \"Convert to Discrete\". After doing that, you can drag it out to Rows. Now, we are going to create a combined field of Beer Name and Brewery Name. To do this click on Beer Name, then hold ctrl and click on Brewery Name. Then, right click -> Create -> Combined Field.

Chris Christie (R) knew that Fort Lee, N.J., had issues with traffic congestion around the George Washington Bridge, long before he authorized a seemingly unnecessary study that closed down lanes to the bridge and made traffic even worse.\n\nFort Lee is an essential access point to New York City, serving as the gateway to the George Washington Bridge, which is the busiest bridge in the United States. In November 2010, Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (D) wrote to Bill Baroni, deputy director of the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, and complained of traffic problems in the borough. The letter was obtained by The Record in a public records request.\n\n\"On approximately 20 occasions in the last forty days, our Borough has been completely gridlocked,\" wrote Sokolich to Baroni, who was Christie's top official at the Port Authority. \"Traveling from the south to the north end of our Borough takes upwards of one hour. Our safety vehicles are unable to traverse our own thoroughfares to attend to emergencies which place our residents in harms way.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, on Sept. 9, 2013, Sokolich woke up to find that two of the three local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge had been closed, causing dangerous traffic jams in the borough on the first day of school. Neither he nor Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye -- who was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) -- were given any advance warning.\n\nThe closures were ordered by David Wildstein, then the director of interstate capital projects and an ally of Christie's. They came just weeks after Sokolich refused to endorse Christie's reelection bid. On Sept. 12, Sokolich said he believed the closures were \"punitive,\" although he later backed off that accusation.\n\nBaroni has stated that the closures were part of a traffic study, implying that Fort Lee may not need three access lanes.\n\n\"Every one of you, every one of you on this committee has people in your communities who sit in longer traffic every day because of the special lanes for Fort Lee,\" Baroni said in November.\n\nBut he acknowledged that no one ever sought approval for the study, which, without an alternative route, was guaranteed to create traffic congestion.\n\nAccording to The Record, a bridge official said Wildstein also specifically instructed him to keep the lane closures secret from Fort Lee officials. And records indicate, according to the paper, \"that traffic engineers predicted it would lead to 600-vehicle back-ups during the morning rush hour that would not subside until noon.\"\n\nWildstein and Baroni have since resigned and hired attorneys to represent them.\n\nIn a Dec. 17 press conference on the controversy, Christie stood by Baroni's explanation for the closures, saying that while his appointees did not go through the proper channels for the closures, there was no malicious or political intent in what they did.\n\nStill, the controversy has continued to dog Christie, who is considered a possible 2016 presidential contender. Sen. John \"Jay\" Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has asked the Transportation Department to review what happened in Fort Lee.\n\n\"While this type of decision tends to be local in nature, I am concerned about the larger federal implications of what appears to be political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice,\" wrote Rockefeller in his letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.\n\nThe inspector general of the Port Authority is also investigating the closures, and several state legislators continue to look into the matter.\n\nLast week, Christie said the controversy was \"not that big a deal\" even though reporters were \"obsessed\" with it.", "greedy": "WASHINGTON -- New documents reveal that a high-ranking official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was involved in a scheme to funnel millions of dollars to a company that was involved in a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme in Colombia, according to a report released Thursday.\n\nThe documents,", "top-k": "WASHINGTON -- New documents reveal that a high-ranking official in the Obama administration was directly involved in a \"secret\" program in which the government collected the records of U.S. citizens, including U.S. citizens abroad.\n\nThe documents, released Wednesday by the National Security Agency, also", "beam": "WASHINGTON -- New documents reveal that a high-ranking official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was involved in a conspiracy to cover up the fact that the U.S. government was spying on Americans.\n\nThe documents, obtained by Judicial Watch through a Freedom of", "greedy_mauve": 0.9733165656582141, "top-k_mauve": 0.9940018878738601, "beam_mauve": 0.9929695655519764}, {"id": 255131, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "New household formations finally seem to be picking up, but it's not because young people are moving out of mom and dad's house, according to a study released Monday by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley.\n\nIn fact, \"age groups younger than 55 collectively had negative household formation between 2014 and 2015, while 65- to 74-year-olds accounted for more than two-thirds of overall household formation,\" the report said.\n\nA separate report released Monday by Zillow found that first-time home buyers today are older, renting longer, are less likely to be married and are spending a lot more of their income on homes today versus first-time buyers in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBoth reports add to the growing body of research on why Millennials are taking so long to strike out on their own, which is of great interest to Realtors, home builders and economists.\n\nHistorically, population growth alone results in the formation of about 1.2 million new households per year on average, said Jed Kolko, author of the Terner Center report. During the recession, this number \"got down into only a few hundred thousand\" as more people stayed with parents longer or found roommates.\n\nRecent census data suggest that the rate of new household formation has started to improve, although there is conflicting data as to the start and size of the increase. The data cited most often showed a big year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of last year, with gains continuing into this year.\n\nIt was assumed that Millennials, having found jobs, are now getting their own places.\n\nBut a recent report from the Pew Center showed that's not true.\n\nEven though unemployment among 18- to 34-year olds has dropped dramatically \u2014 to 7.7 percent early this year from 12.4 percent in 2010 \u2014 people this age are less likely to be living independently. Only 67 percent were living independently early this year, compared with 69 percent in 2010 and 71 percent in 2007, the Pew report said.\n\nIf young adults are not increasingly striking out on their own, then what accounts for the increase in new household formation?\n\nKolko attempted to answer this question by adding up the population growth between the first half of 2015 and the first half of 2014 for various age groups and multiplying by each group's headship rate. Headship is the percentage of adults who head a household.\n\nLike the Pew study, his analysis found that despite the job recovery, the percentage of young adults living with their parents continued to rise, even through June 2015.\n\nHe found that the headship rate fell or remained flat for all age groups from 20 to 64. \"The only notable increase in headship rate was for 65- to 74-year-olds,\" he said.\n\nHis conclusion: \"Household formation is being driven by overall population growth and the aging of the population, but not a broad increase in headship rates. The recent gain in household formation appears to be due to basic demographic shifts rather than the economic cycle.\"\n\nWhat the data can't explain is why young adults are living at home even after they get a job.\n\n\"One contributing factor is that 25 to 34-year-olds are decreasingly likely to be married or cohabitating with a partner, and \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 married or cohabitating young adults rarely live with their parents (just 2% do), compared with 31% of those who aren't living with a spouse or partner,\" Kolko wrote. The decline in marriage among young adults predates the recession.\n\nAnother possible factor is that \"rent affordability is worsening broadly,\" Kolko said. \"When young people move out, it is usually to rent, not to own.\" After the bubble burst, home prices fell precipitously, but rents did not. \"Demand for renting rose as people lost homes to foreclosure or couldn't get a mortgage,\" he said.\n\nSaving up for a down payment on a home is harder when rents are rapidly rising.\n\nA third possible reason is that \"the quality of jobs being created\" is not good enough to let young people move out on their own, at least in the style they have become accustomed to.\n\nFirst-time home buyers: Zillow's report on first-time home buyers echoes some of the same themes.\n\nIt found that:\n\n\u2022First-time buyers are older than than they were in the past. The median age was about 32.5 in 2010-14, versus 29 in 1975-79.\n\n\u2022Americans are renting longer before buying a home. The median was 6 years between 2010 and 2014, versus 2.6 years in 1970-74.\n\n\u2022They are less likely to be married. Only 40 percent were married in 2010-14, versus 52 percent in 1985-90.\n\n\u2022They are spending a lot more of their income on a home.

That followed a ruling by a federal judge in Wisconsin that residents without a photo ID will still be allowed to vote.\n\nHasen said the Obama administration took on the North Carolina and Texas cases as a bulwark against voting restrictions.\n\n\"If North Carolina and Texas could get away with these voting restrictions, it would have been a green light for other states to do so,\" he said. \"I think this is a hugely important decision.\"\n\nNorth Carolina's voting laws were rewritten in 2013 by the General Assembly two years after Republicans took control of both legislative chambers for the first time in a century. It was also shortly after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling changed the requirement that many Southern states receive federal approval before changing voting laws.\n\nThe voter ID mandate, which took effect in March, required people casting ballots in person to show one of six qualifying IDs, although voters facing \"reasonable impediments\" could fill out a form and cast a provisional ballot.\n\nNorth Carolina legislators imposed the photo ID requirement, curtailed early voting and eliminated same-day registration and voters' ability to cast out-of-precinct provisional ballots in their home counties.\n\nThe appeals court cited data that these methods were used disproportionately by black voters, who also were more likely to lack a qualifying ID, and it blocked the contested provisions of the law.\n\nThe judges wrote that in the years before the North Carolina law took effect, registration and participation by black voters had been dramatically increasing.\n\n\"We recognize that elections have consequences, but winning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination,\" the panel said.\n\nThe Rev.

This means he was Katharina of Aragon's nephew, and Mary I's cousin, and he would later give Henry VIII a hard row to hoe over the English king's attempt to divorce his Spanish wife in favor of Anne Boleyn. In fact, he would keep meddling in English politics for the next several decades, culminating in his son's marriage to Mary I.\n\nHowever, that bedevilment was still years in the future when Charles was crowned, so Henry VIII was probably pleased as punch to have an Imperial in-law.

This is roughly the population of El Paso, TX!\n\nThis data was assembled from NASBA's interstate database that holds records from all 55 state boards and licensing authorities except four: Hawaii, Wisconsin, Utah, and Delaware. These four states have approved the interstate information sharing process, but have yet to be implemented into the system.\n\nHow Many CPAs are in the US?\n\nI know what you are thinking. If this is the total of all CPA licenses in all states, won't it be double counting the CPAs who are licensed in multiple states? Great question, but they already thought about that and made sure not to double count individual licensed in more than one state.\n\nThis 2016 figure is up since the 2006 data that showed 646,520 licensed and active CPAs in the United States. This increase is a good sign for the profession and a good sign for the financial industry overall, but it is not that impressive.\n\nWhat Does This Trend Mean?\n\nGenerally, the growing trend of people becoming CPAs and entering in the profession would be a good thing, and it is. But, the growth has become stagnant over the last few years, only growing at a rate of 1 percent. This isn't a large boom by any means.\n\nActually, if you look back to the 1990s, the total number of first time CPA candidates in the US has declined about 20 percent. This means less people are taking the exam each year as compared with prior years.\n\nIn other words, people are becoming CPAs at a lessor rate than in previous decades. It's unclear as to what is causing this decrease in people becoming certified, but it is clear that several things in the certification process have changed since the 1990s.\n\nFor example, most states now require additional work experience requirements and 150 college credit hours to become licensed. These increased requirements most likely have contributed to this decline.\n\nPlus, there are many other career options available than in the 1990s. For example, computer science engineers and programmers were not nearly as big as they are today. These careers might be pulling potential future CPAs away from the profession.\n\nKeep in mind that just because the rate of people becoming a CPA for the first time is slowing down, it doesn't mean that accounting jobs are going anywhere.\n\nHow Many Accountants are CPAs?\n\nAccounting jobs in the US and internationally keep increasing year over year according to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics.\n\nThere are roughly 1.3M accountants in the US and only about 650,000 CPAs. Thus, approximately 50 percent of all accountants are licensed CPAs.\n\nNo Better Time to Become a CPA\n\nThere's no better time to become a CPA than right now. The worldwide demand for certified public accountants is at an all time high. The overall growth might be slowly slightly, but the total demand is still growing.\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor and Statistics estimates that the demand for accountants will increase upwards of 10 percent in the next 5 years. With all of the new government regulations from healthcare to retirement savings, there is no question that number will be even higher. Business Insider reported that accountants will be the number 1 demanded career over the next 10 years.\n\nCPAs are not only needed domestically, they are needed internationally too. Candidates from more than 100 countries around the world are taking the CPA exam, so they can prepare SEC filings for international companies among other things.\n\nIf you aren't a CPA yet, you should serious consider joining the profession.

It fractured the boy's jaw and shattered some teeth before it went out his other cheek, all while he held his mother's hand.\n\n\"He was with his mother, and it wasn't like I was doing something wrong, having him out after hours,\" said Brashear, a 21-year-old single mother of two, referring to the shooting that happened before sundown June 28 on Chicago's South Side. \"I thought he was safe.\"\n\nKavan is part of a growing roster of children who have been shot in the city this year amid a spike in killings and shootings. More than 330 killings have occurred in the city.\n\nSo far, no child has died from the gunfire that's often connected to gangs. Children have been struck while doing normal kid things like playing with sparklers, drawing on the sidewalk or holding a mother's hand.\n\nStatistics that The Associated Press requested from the Police Department show children ages 10 to 17, who make up more than 260 of the victims so far this year, are at greater risk than those younger than 10. But police records through the end of June showed 15 children younger than 10 had been shot, which is seven more young shooting victims than the same span last year.\n\nFour more young children have been shot since the start of July, including a 6-year-old girl who was sitting on a porch Tuesday with her mother and grandmother when a bullet \u2014 one of more than 40 fired a block away \u2014 struck her in the stomach.\n\nPolice are trying to determine if the gunfire that struck Tacarra Morgan in the West Englewood neighborhood on the South Side was an exchange between people inside a caravan of cars and a group of men on the street. They say another possibility is that someone in one of the vehicles sprayed the area with a high-capacity assault weapon.\n\nTacarra's condition was upgraded from critical to serious, a hospital official said Wednesday.\n\nThe shootings, mostly in neighborhoods on the South and West sides, underline what the residents already knew: It's a dangerous time for the city's children as well.\n\nBut since the recent shootings of young victims haven't been deadly, they have received little attention outside Chicago. The children haven't become national symbols of the city's violence like 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee, who was lured into an alley last November with the promise of a juice box and shot to death, allegedly by gang members out to punish his father.\n\nOther children besides Kavan have been struck by gunfire while doing nothing other than being kids, leaving their families to wonder if there's anything they can do to protect them. The victims include:\n\n\u2014 Six-year-old Jaylene Bermeo, who was drawing with sidewalk chalk on the evening of June 6 in the Logan Square neighborhood on the city's northwest side when she was shot in the back. The bullet punctured her lung and lodged near her heart. Police say a 17-year-old boy accidentally shot the girl when he opened fire on rival gang members as he drove down the block.\n\n\u2014 Three-year-old Devon Quinn, who was with his dad on Father's Day in a car in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the South Side when someone pulled up and fired at least 10 shots at the vehicle. Prosecutors say the gunman was a gang member who opened fire in a rival gang's territory to pay tribute to a dead member of his own gang. At a court hearing, prosecutors said the boy was left paralyzed from the chest down and that he will never be able to move his limbs or even breathe on his own.\n\n\u2014 Five-year-old Taniyah Williams and her 8-year-old cousin, Corey Bondurant, who were playing with sparklers on the evening of July 4 in the West Englewood neighborhood on the South Side when someone sprayed the area with bullets.

Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman has made a huge amount of money, and became an example of how to bring a hero to the screen with style and substance.

We're post-Logan, post-Deadpool and each new direction a comic book movie succeeds with could well become a template for all that follow.\n\nSo, all eyes are on DC for the foreseeable future. Today we received confirmation that Matthew Vaughn is in talks with DC about the sequel to Man of Steel, and it could be a whole new take on the cinematic Superman.\n\nThe Kick-Ass director was in the mix at Warner Bros. when they were looking to bring about the new cinematic DCEU. The studio ultimately went with the Christopher Nolan/David S. Goyer re-invention of Superman and the visually impressive, yet emotionally cold Man of Steel was the first step into a wider franchise.\n\nCommenting on his 2010 pitch, before Man of Steel went into production, Vaughn offered his opinion to MTV on what a new Superman film should be,\n\n\"I think that's the one thing not to do with Superman, trying to do the serious The Dark Knight version. Superman is about color and fun, or it should be, for me.\"\n\nSpeaking to us at the press junket for Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Vaughn confirmed to Scott Davis,\n\n\"I am planning another Kingman, I've written the treatment and some of the scenes\u2026I don't know what I'm going to do next but I have had chats about Superman, I love Superman. \"If somebody asks me to do Indiana Jones, most of the superheros or Star Wars the fanboy in me can't help but be excited.\"\n\nSee the interview below,\n\nMatthew Vaughn on the new Superman film\n\nTone has been a very difficult element for the DCEU. Though it came in the shadow of The Avengers, Man of Steel, and the follow-up Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, were cast firmly in the, often mocked, 'dark and gritty' mould. At the time it was an understandable decision. Let the tone serve the story, and comparisons to the Marvel films would be moot. However the reaction to Batman v Superman gave the DCEU a stumble on its second step, and the trailers for Suicide Squad subsequently focused heavily on the film's humour. There were dozens of news stories dedicated to how the Justice League film would be lighter and tone, and funnier.\n\nIf Vaughn, and his long time collaborative partner Jane Goldman, are on board for a new Superman film it could be a bold, stabilising step for the ongoing franchise. When the X-Men franchise from Bryan Singer (another Superman director) faltered with the execrable Last Stand, it was Vaughn and Goldman who reinvigorated the series with X-Men: First Class.

Firstly, his son Hafiz Zaenullah, his brother Asif Iqbal and another man \u2013 a stonemason called Khaliq Dad \u2013 were killed by a drone attack on Mr Khan's home in December 2009. Secondly, he had filed a legal case in Pakistan against the American drone strikes, arguing that they constituted murder under domestic law. And thirdly \u2013 perhaps Mr Khan's most serious crime \u2013 he was about to leave for Brussels to address European Union parliamentarians on the dangers of American drone strikes in Pakistan.\n\nIn Madiha Tahir's recent documentary film Wounds of Waziristan, Mr Khan had talked about his family loss. His son Hafiz was a security guard at a local girls' school, and also studying for Grade 10. Asif, who had a Master's in English, was a government employee. Karim Khan saw what was left of their bodies, \"covered in wounds\". He found some of their fingers in the rubble of his home.\n\nThanks to constant reports of his kidnapping in the courageous Pakistani media and to the Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court who ordered the Pakistani government to produce Karim Khan by next Thursday, the anti-drone campaigner is safe. For the moment.\n\nBut this is going to set the world on fire. The \"drone war\", as American journalists inevitably call it \u2013 after all, it's not as if al-Qa'ida or the innocent victims are firing back with drones of their own \u2013 started under George W Bush, but most of the attacks, 384 of them since 2008, have been authorised by Mr Obama. The statistics of civilian deaths fluctuate wildly since most of the missiles are fired into the Pakistani frontier districts in which the government has little power. The minimum figure for civilian victims is almost 300 dead \u2013 some say almost 900 \u2013 out of a total of 2,500 killed. At least 50 people are believed to have been killed in follow-up strikes which slaughtered those going to the rescue of the wounded.\n\nOf course, the drone syndrome has spread across the Middle East. The missiles rain down on al-Qa'ida and civilians alike in Yemen. The Israelis fired them into Lebanon in 2006; when a youth on a motorcycle fired at a night-time drone over Beirut, it fired back a missile that destroyed a downtown civilian apartment block. In Gaza, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights reported 825 deaths from Israeli drones during the 2008-09 war, a large percentage of them civilians.\n\nPakistani witnesses have told me that the missiles don't just appear suddenly in the sky. The drones arrive in clusters \u2013 10 or 12 at a time, circling villages for an hour or two \u2013 a looking for targets on behalf of their \"pilots\" in the United States. Until at least 2009, the Americans flew drones \u2013 the most impressive was called the Reaper \u2013 from air bases inside Pakistan. Hence the sensitivities of the boys from the ISI and their irritation with Karim Khan.\n\nThe ethical disgrace of the drone syndrome is not that Mr Obama \u2013 or some US officer near Las Vegas \u2013 decides on the basis of satellite pictures, mobile phone calls, numbers dialled and the speed of vehicles, who should live or die. The really shameful aspect is that the drone war has become normal. It has gone on so long \u2013 and been the subject of so much protest, so regularly \u2013 that it has become banal, boring, matter-of-fact.\n\nIt was just the same in the 1990s when the US and Brits went hunting for Iraqi targets over the so-called \"no-fly zones\" in Iraq. For years they bombed and missiled \"military targets\" that supposedly threatened them. In the eight months up to August 1999, US and British pilots had fired more than 1,100 missiles against 359 Iraqi targets, flying about two-thirds as many missions as Nato pilots conducted over Yugoslavia during the 78-day bombardment of the same year. As well as anti-aircraft batteries, oil pipelines were blown up, storage depots destroyed and dozens of civilians killed, including several in a Basra housing estate. But each air raid was merely \"nibbed\" in our newspapers \u2013 a nib is a single paragraph in an inside-page News in Brief column \u2013 so that an entire air campaign was effectively carried out behind the backs of the US and British public in the years before the 2003 invasion.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, the Israelis controlled for 28 years a torture prison at Khiam for insurgents and their families \u2013 women as well as men \u2013 and electricity was frequently used on inmates by Israel's \"South Lebanon Army\" thugs. Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and the International Red Cross complained. But I will always remember the words of a Swiss Red Cross official when I asked him, within sight of Khiam, why the world did not condemn this dreadful place.", "greedy": "There are, as the cops would say, several facts \"pertaining\" to the case.\n\nThe first is that the police have been investigating the case for a year.

However, it's also been almost as long since they've beaten their next opponent. The Timberwolves will attempt to snap a 15-game skid to the Los Angeles Lakers by taking advantage of their struggles on the road Sunday night. For the third time this season, Minnesota (9-10) is close to evening its record. In the most recent attempt, the Timberwolves were 7-8 before a 108-98 loss at Utah on Jan. 21 but have gotten another chance after two wins over teams from the Lone Star State. After a 105-90 victory in Dallas on Wednesday, they topped San Antonio 87-79 on Friday when Ricky Rubio scored nine of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. Kevin Love also had 18 points in his first home game after signing a four-year extension worth more than $60 million, and was one of three Minnesota players to record double-doubles along with Rubio and center Nikola Pekovic. \"It's a terrific win for our guys,\" coach Rick Adelman said. \"Hopefully it's really a step forward for us.\" Minnesota will try to use take another step by improving to .500 after 20 games for the first time since it was 22-22 on Jan. 30, 2007, and by beating the Lakers for the first time since March 6, 2007. The 15 consecutive losses to Los Angeles (11-9) since that 117-107 double overtime victory at home is the league's second-longest active losing streak to one opponent. Minnesota has dropped 16 in a row to Northwest Division rival Portland. The Timberwolves, though, might have one of their best chances to snap that skid as the Lakers are 1-7 away from home. They opened a road-heavy stretch Saturday with a 100-89 loss in Milwaukee. A Kobe Bryant jumper put Los Angeles within four points of the Bucks with 4:52 remaining, but Milwaukee responded with a 15-4 run. The Lakers, who are playing seven of their next eight on the road, are off to their worst start on the road since dropping eight of their first nine in 2002-03. They're also seeking to avoid their first five-game road losing streak since March 4-15, 2007. \"There's concern and determination that we want to fix things. If we solve that issue, then we'll be all right,\" Bryant said after his team lost for the fourth time in five games overall. Los Angeles can help itself by scoring 100 or more points for the first time in 14 games. The Lakers, winners of seven in a row at the Target Center, haven't surpassed 96 in any of their eight road contests. They're averaging 89.6 points away from home but have topped the century mark in seven of their last nine in Minnesota. This time, though, Los Angeles will face a Timberwolves team that's made impressive strides defensively in its first season under Adelman. Minnesota is allowing 93.5 points per game after giving a league-worst 107.7 per contest in 2010-11. The Timberwolves, though, could use more help from Love against the Lakers. The California native has averaged 12.2 points in 11 all-time matchups, his lowest against a Western Conference opponent. He's averaged 10.0 points on 33.3 percent shooting in five home games and had one of two scoreless starts in his career during a 112-95 loss Nov. 19, 2010. Bryant, who broke Jerry West's franchise record for free throws made Saturday, is four field goals shy of surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's team mark of 9,935.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Just when it looked as though the Lakers were going to let another road game slip away, Kobe Bryant showed these young pups just how it's done in closing time. Bryant had 35 points and 14 rebounds and Pau Gasol scored 28 to give the Lakers a much-needed road victory, 106-101 over the Timberwolves on Sunday night.

We brought our tent, food and just took off. In 6 years we visited more than 50 countries and we traveled more than 100,000 miles on 5 continents. So far we never paid for accommodations and we almost always cooked our own meals.\n\nOur car broke down at least 50 times, but we learned how to repair it during the trip. Followers from our blog helped us along the way and people even supported fuel costs.

Our blog is very popular among young people \u2013 we have over 80,000 fans on Facebook. Our blog has been voted Best Blog of the Year in 2014 in Poland, and we appeared on major TV stations!

Now I can fix most things in our freedom vessel, but with a different car it would probably be a different story! In our van probably everything broke down so I know everything about it. One of our worst breakdown was when we had to change the engine in Norway without any access to a garage! But THE worst breakdown occurred in Australia when we lost a wheel. We got stuck in the middle of the desert (obviously our phones would not work), hundreds of kilometers from civilization and with limited water supplies. It's hard to drive a car without a wheel but we were able to move very slowly \u2013 somebody had to run next to the wheel and hit it with a stick!\n\nHow many countries total did you visit ? How many with your van ?\n\nWe visited about 55 countries, 52 with our van. We shipped the van from Australia to the United States. When we couldn't use the van because transportation was too expensive, we hitchhiked and used local transportation or hire another camper (as we did for example in New Zealand).\n\nCan you give us a unusual tip to travel cheap with a van?\n\nIt depends where you are traveling. In Australia it is a good idea to install WikiCamps app to find free campsites. With the same app in Ukraine and Romania you can ask people if you can park in their driveway! People are very friendly over there and will almost always invite you into their home and tell you amazing stories.\n\nWhich countries were your favorite to explore with a van ?\n\nAustralia for their free campsites, beautiful nature, free electric grills and cheap kangaroo meat!

Tomaso Aste of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies at the University College London's Department of Computer Science thinks the current cost large and wasteful, but nonetheless, fair. Aste recently examined the factors that determine the current proof of work cost in a study titled \"The fair cost of Bitcoin proof of work.\"\n\nAste noted that bitcoin has proven that untrustful peers can exchange value over the Internet without any third party intermediary or trusted authority, as bitcoin has surpassed $10 billion in capitalization and processes tens of thousands of daily transactions with any serious challenge of attack.\n\nComputationally Intensive Process\n\nThe verification and cryptographic sealing mechanism that is critical to the bitcoin network involves a computationally intensive process. A large number of nodes in the bitcoin network engage in the verification process.\n\nThe process provides a mechanism that avoids false duplications of voters and forces voters to demonstrate computational capacity. To secure a qualified majority, the system employs a cryptographic sealing process that is computationally intensive. The process includes a challenge called \"proof of work.\" The first node that solves this challenge receives a bitcoin reward. This mechanism, called \"mining,\" enables new bitcoins to be created.\n\nMiners worldwide generate several billions hashes (10^18 or one Exahash) every second. With existing hardware, the computation of a billion hashes consumes between 0.1 to 1 Joule of energy. Hence, roughly a billion watts (1GW/sec) are used globally every second to create a valid proof of work.\n\nThe amount of energy for this process accounts for about $50,000 per hour, although electricity costs change worldwide.\n\nMiner Reward: 12.5 Bitcoins\n\nSince the system currently processes under 10,000 transactions hourly, the per-transaction cost exceeds $5. The user does not pay the cost. The miners pay the cost and are rewarded with the accreditation of new bitcoins.\n\nThe individual proof of work reward was 25 bitcoins leading up to the halving, equating to about $15,000 at current change.\n\nThe mining community is estimated to consume an average of around $50,000/6, equaling $8,333 in electricity every 10 minutes to create a block, receiving around $15,000 in remuneration. This makes the mining operation profitable, even taking into account the infrastructure and hardware cost.\n\nThe electricity cost for one year of mining totals more than $400 million. This can be viewed as a significant waste.\n\nThe reward, now cut in half to 12.5 bitcoins, will leave smaller profit margins, Aste noted.\n\nProof Of Work Benefits\n\nProof of work allows the blockchain to remain \"pure\" and lets an entire community compete to verify the validity of transactions and make attacks to the system costly.\n\nIs the cost justified? Aste claims the cost should make a double spending attack too expensive to be executed.\n\nA double spending attack would occur when someone tries to gain more bitcoin by spending the same bitcoin with different users. The attacker would attempt to double spend the highest amount of bitcoin possible. The amount is limited to that which is normally exchanged within a block, which is currently about $1 million.\n\nA transaction that includes a higher sum than the total transaction value in a block will attract attention from the network. This reality limits double spending to about $1 million. While the duplication can be repeated serially or in parallel several times, it does not affect the present computation's outcomes.\n\nProtection From Attacks\n\nThe attacker can try to gain a fraction of $1 million. To do so, the attacker has to be sure both the duplicated transactions are validated. This requires a fork with two blocks attached to the previous block.\n\nIf the attacker has sufficient computing power, it is possible to generate two valid hashes to seal both blocks to create the impression that both transactions were verified. For a final transaction settlement, it is necessary to wait for six new blocks to join the blockchain to ensure the transaction is unlikely to be reverted.\n\nThe attacker has to generate six valid hashes before the double spend transaction can be considered settled. The attacker only has to artificially validate one of the two forks, the shortest. The system will consider the other to be valid and let to propagate by other miners. The attacker can propagate it as well.\n\nIt is unrealistic to assume no one will notice the propagating fork, Aste noted, but this assumption is made for the purpose of this hypothesis.\n\nAlso read: How proof of work\u2026works\n\nHow Attacks Are Discouraged\n\nThe fork's artificial propagation cost is the proof of work cost times six. The attacker will profit if the cost is less than the gain. The break-even point is represented by the following equation: the fair equilibrium cost of proof of work equals the duplicated fraction of the value of a block divided by the number", "greedy": "Advertisement Is the cost of proof of work in bitcoin too high?

My initial San Diego experience was at a very impressionable time in my life.\n\n\nI only \"liked\" professional baseball and football, but the San Diego community (and local teams) only enhanced that \"like\" and grew it into a love. I quickly grew into a diehard San Diego Padres (and Chargers) fan and I have been a fanatic of those two teams for the last 22 years. Tony Gwynn was the superstar for the Padres and he became my favorite baseball player the more and more I watched and listen to him.\n\n\nLiving in San Diego, I went to as many baseball games as I could. Back in my early twenties, the Padres played at Jack Murphy Stadium, and the cheap tickets in right field were only $7 (back when baseball was considered the affordable sport), so we went to a lot of games. The best games were the Dodger/Padres of course, and Tony Gwynn always showed up and played great. Back then the Padres and Tony Gwynn were known as The Dodger Killers, as they always managed to beat their biggest rival L.A (the Giants on the other hand were quite opposite). It was Tony Gwynn's team for 20 years and San Diegans loved their perennial all-star. No matter how terrible the Padres were, San Diego always had Tony Gwynn\u2026\n\n\nIn the 2001 season, the last season of Gwynn's career, was my most remembered of him. How he lasted on the same team his whole career made me admire him more, as he taught sacrifice. Tony did not start that season, as he had a knee injury and he was primarily used as a pinch-hitter. Most Padres fans knew it was going to be Gwynn's final season, and since he did not start that season, it made attending every game even more important (just so you can get that final glimpse of the Mr. San Diego legend). As most pinch-hitters are used, in the latter innings of close games, fans would be anxious (at a warm idle) in hope the Padres could get a runner in scoring position, then Padres fans could \"possibly\" see Tony Gwynn come in for a pinch-hit. I got to see one of those close games, might have been his last too, and Tony hit a pinch hit single, drove in the winning run and the crowd went haywire.\n\n\nI think the older we get, the more emotional we get, or we can actually recognize what we can lose even more (especially when we can relate our own experiences with those reminders of our past). The story of my favorite baseball player had so many chapters of Tony Gwynn's 20 year career, with each year (or Chapter) being so different. From a young kid and growing into the man I am today, I can feel and empathize what Tony Gwynn did then, and related it to me, and what I was doing then. Being just a fan of a guy lets me combine his career and achievements, to where I've been in my own life.\n\n\nI was always a fan of Tony Gwynn (the player, the person, the coach and the broadcaster). These \"links\" of history that we tie with the players we admire the most helps us look at ourselves (by reminding us of our own past and where we are now). I was only a fan of Tony Gwynn and I never met him, but he was Mr. San Diego and everyone in San Diego (and beyond) loved him. The moments of Tony Gwynn's career are joined and bonded together through my life, as well as other fans across the globe. Remembering what he did makes me think of where I was, when he did it. When I was 20, 30 and 40 years old, Tony Gwynn's career accomplishments remind me of several moment of my own life. When Tony Gwynn spoke, people were drawn to him. Aside his baseball accomplishments; his gift of gab, his charisma, and his smile were mesmerizing and he will truly be immortalize in my heart and with all baseball fans alike.\n\n\nTony Gwynn, Mr. San Diego, died today from cancer. He was 54 years old.\n\n\nAdvertisements", "greedy": "6/16/2014 \u2013 by James Fedewa I moved to Pacific Beach, CA from the Bay Area. I was a student at UC Berkeley and had a great time there.

If you're building or updating a website, you're probably wondering about which content management system (CMS) to use. A CMS helps users \u2014 particularly non-technical users \u2014 to add pages and blog posts, embed videos and images, and incorporate other content into their site. CMS options You could go with something quick and do-it-yourself, like WordPress (read more about WordPress) or a drag-and-drop builder like Squarespace. If you need greater functionality, like user account management or asset tracking, or if you're concerned about security and extensibility, you'll need a more robust CMS. That means using a framework to build a complex website that can manage large volumes of data and content. Wait, what's a framework? Put simply, a framework is a library of reusable code that is easily edited by a web developer to produce custom products more quickly than coding everything from scratch. Django and Drupal are both frameworks with dedicated functionality for content management, but there is a key difference between them: Drupal combines aspects of a web application framework with aspects of a CMS Django separates the framework and the CMS The separation that Django provides makes it easier for content managers to use the CMS because ...

The scientists did lots of cool programming stuff. But they did not use version control, so they introduced git :-) They also had lots and lots of data, so they introduced Apache Spark. Their data sets were in ascii files, which are huge. So the ascii files need to be parsed. He showed an example of a file with DNA data. Ouch, it turns out to be pretty complex because there are quite some exceptions. Fields (in this example) are separated by semicolons. But some of the values also contain semicolons (quoted, though). So the generic python code they used to parse their DNA data was littered with \"if\" statements. Unmaintainable. You probably heard that hard problems need to be split up into smaller problems. Yes, that's true. But the smaller parts also need to be combined again. So: smaller parsers + a combining them again. A parser takes an input and returns the part that matched and the part that remained. He showed parsy as a library for \"parser combinators\". Many languages have such libraries.

I appreciated all of the comments, especially those from people who are just on the brink of sharing with their partners. I hope you all find strength and support in the CR community! NEDA week is still up and running, so please keep these issues fresh in your minds. And, fellow bloggers, let me know if you write NEDA posts of your own!\n\nI don't think I have to say too much about the deliciousness above. Guacamole. Sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes grilled with a spice rub. What more could one ask for, except seconds and thirds? Seriously, sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods: they're one of the more healthy and natural ways to get your carb attack on, and their sweetness gives them tremendous versatility. They're standard dinner fare for me, but I can easily eat them for breakfast, as we all just learned when I posted my sweet potato breakfast salad with almond butter protein dressing:\n\nToday's recipe is quick and easy, but it's also an impressive appetizer dish to share at parties or as a first course for dinner at home. I grilled my sweet potato rounds on my Cuisinart indoor grill/griddle (this year's holiday request), but baking them will work every bit as nicely. And of course, if you have an outdoor grill, have at it. Grilling sweet potatoes brings out their caramel flavors, and it's a great opportunity to crack out a spicy, smoky mixture of seasonings.\n\nChili-Rubbed Sweet Potato Rounds with Guacamole (vegan, gluten free, soy free)\n\nServes 4\n\nFor the chili spice rub:\n\n2 tbsps chili powder\n\n1 tsp paprika (I use regular here, but use smoked paprika if you want a smoky flavor!)\n\n1 tsp coriander\n\n1/2 tsp cinnamon\n\n1/2 tsp sea salt\n\nDash cayenne pepper (omit if you don't want the heat)\n\nFor the dish:\n\n1 large sweet potato, sliced into 1/4 inch rounds\n\nCoconut oil (optional)\n\n1 recipe classic Choosing Raw guacamole\n\n1) If you're baking your sweet 'taters, pre-heat oven to 425 degrees. If you're grilling them, first prepare a pot of boiling water with a steamer insert.\n\n2) Mix spices together for the rub.\n\n3) Oven method: Brush or spray potatoes lightly with coconut oil (you can omit this if you're avoiding oils). Sprinkle them with the spice rub. Roast round for about 12-15 minutes, or until golden on the bottoms. Flip and roast for another 12-15 minutes.\n\nGrill method: Steam sweet potato rounds for about eight minutes\u2013you don't want them cooked through, but you do want them to be most of the way there. Remove from steam heat, spray or brush lightly with coconut oil (totally optional), dust with chili rub, and transfer to grill. Grill for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until nicely browned.\n\n4) Whip up a batch of classic CR guacamole. Transfer it to a plastic bag, and snip one corner of the bag so that you can pipe out the guac (I almost wrote \"pipette out\" the guac\u2013too much biochem lab).\n\nPipe the guac onto the rounds as if you were frosting cupcakes. (NB: My guac didn't look much better after piping than it might have if I'd used a spoon. So this step, while nice, is definitely optional).\n\n5) Serve, savor, swoon.\n\nThe light, bright, lemony guacamole pairs perfectly with the dense, sweet, and smoky sweet potatoes in this scrumptious recipe. Added bonus? Lots of complex carbs and healthy fat make this an incredibly satiating\u2014as well as a supremely delicious\u2014snack or appetizer.\n\nHealthy, simple, and satisfying. The best kind of party food.\n\nHope you keep this recipe in mind for either winter or summer entertaining; one of its benefits is that it features produce from both seasons, and it's very versatile!\n\nWith that, it's back to a long day of biochem lab and Orgo reports.

It reads, \"Orrick: 5 Miles.\" Just as I went by, the Rolling Stones \"Gimme Shelter\" came on the radio.\n\nPerfect. I lived in Orrick, Missouri, at the time, and \"Gimme Shelter\" was not only my favorite Rolling Stones tune, it was also four minutes, thirty-seven seconds long, which would last me all the way home.\n\nThen my drive fell out of reality.\n\nA pull on the car engine snapped me out of the road hypnosis that had overtaken me. It took me a few seconds to realize that pull was the cruise control trying to keep the speed steady up a hill. The trouble was there were no hills between that road sign and my turnoff. Looking out the window didn't help; a thick fog had enveloped the car and I could barely see the dotted line on the road. I slowed the car and drove up two more hills before I saw a light piercing through the fog.\n\nTurning onto a gravel road toward the light, I found myself in the parking lot of a Jehovah's Witness church and knew where I was \u2013 five miles on the other side of my turnoff. As I sat in the parking lot, my car in park, trying to figure out how I missed the exit, I heard something I couldn't believe. \"Gimme Shelter\" still played on the radio. It continued to play for another minute and a half.\n\nAfter I calmed a bit, I put the car in gear, pulled back onto the highway and went home. The fog quickly dissipated. I'd driven ten miles in three minutes at 55 mph. That wasn't possible. What happened to me?\n\nCases of missing time and distance are as common as they are confusing. The Internet is littered with tales of travelers entering a fog only to discover they're suddenly 300 miles away from home, or they've gone nowhere, but it's inexplicably hours later. Explanations range from time slips, to dimensional slips, to alien abduction. Whatever the case, Brandon White of Maryville, Missouri, has experienced missing time and distance; more than once. \"The first time I was about ten and I was walking out in the front yard,\" White said. It was just after lunch.\n\nAs White went toward a thick ring of pine trees that surrounded his family's farmhouse, he saw something floating on the other side of the tree line. \"It was pale, sort of translucent,\" he said. \"It was passing between our house and the neighbor's house. I thought it was a blimp.\"\n\nHis afternoon suddenly disappeared. \"The next thing I remember was coming in for dinner; 5 or 5:30,\" he said. \"I didn't think about it at the time. As a kid, time was nothing.\"\n\nBut five hours of his life were just gone.\n\nIn his teens, his life got stranger. \"At 13 or 14 I stopped sleeping. I was deathly afraid of sleep,\" he said. \"I would fall to sleep, get into an REM sleep, and start screaming. I would wake up in strange places. In the yard, on the porch, upside down hanging from my bunk bed.\" White said he doesn't remember when he's been able to catch more than four hours of sleep a night. \"I had very vivid nightmares,\" he said. Those nightmares often included a bird. \"A big black crow. It would flap over my face, trying to take my breath.\"\n\nLater in his teens when White worked at Long John Silver's in a town 38 miles away, he experienced more missing time. \"I was riding my motorcycle. I remember that night very specifically. I worked a double shift,\" he said. \"Before I left town, I filled up my (gas) tank.\" As he pulled onto a gravel road toward his parent's house, he saw an orange ball hanging low in the sky. \"I stopped and thought, 'the moon's a weird color,'\" he said. \"Then I saw it was not the moon. The moon doesn't block the landscape.\" As he got closer, he saw this orange ball was thirty to forty feet in diameter, and hovered five or six feet off the ground.\n\nHe got off the motorcycle three hours simply disappeared. \"It's the last thing I remember,\" he said. \"It was 7:35 p.m. At 10:30 p.m. I pulled into Dad's driveway and something zoomed over me and disappeared into a valley.\"\n\nHe stopped the bike and got off, leaving it running as he dashed to a fence to look for the light.

Consumers have long chafed at having to pay for set-top boxes to get a cable signal.\n\n\"If adopted, consumers will no longer have to rent a set-top box, month after month,\" Wheeler wrote. \"Instead, pay-TV providers will be required to provide apps -- free of charge -- that consumers can download to the device of their choosing to access all the programming and features they already paid for.\"\n\nWheeler's proposal comes six months after the Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 along party lines to begin crafting rules intended to spur competition in the set-top box market by developing technology standards so that third-party devices and apps could decode pay-TV signals.\n\nSuch a service would enable consumers to watch cable channels over on an Internet-connected television or device such as an Xbox, Roku or AppleTV.\n\nCable and satellite companies collect a combined $20 billion annually in rental fees, adding to the overall cost of cable or satellite service. Wheeler cited an analysis that said consumers pay an average of $231 annually for the use of a box.\n\nWheeler's plan was praised by consumer groups but met with strong criticism by the cable industry. The companies and their trade group, the NationalCable and Telecommunications Assocation, characterized Wheeler's plan as an act of government overreach that goes beyond the FCC's authority.\n\n\"This proposal would far exceed the Commission's legal authority and improperly insert the government into private contract negotiations between payTV distributors, content creators and device manufacturers,\" the NCTA said in a statement.\n\nWheeler, who has long been an advocate of bringing down the cost of video service to consumers, said studies have shown that 84 percent of consumers believe their cable bill is too high. About 99 percent of the nation's 100 million pay-TV subscribers rent at least one set-top box.\n\n\"We keep paying these charges even after the cost of the box has been recovered because we have no meaningful alternative,\" he said.\n\nWheeler also believes the industry needs to adapt to the technological changes that have already upended the television industry through the increased number of programming choices they have provided. A rapidly growing number of consumers, especially in the 18 to 34 age group, are turning to online streaming for their video content and want more options through Internet platforms.\n\n\"This proposal is an important step in giving consumers new, innovative choices in a market that's had limited -- if any -- competition for years,\" Consumers Union said in a statement.\n\nWheeler's plan gives large pay TV providers, such as Comcast and DirecTV, two years to offer streaming apps to their customers. Medium-sized companies would have an additional two years while smaller providers would be exempt.\n\nAbout 90 percent of cable and satellite customers are served by the companies that will have to adopt the service in two years.\n\nCable companies already have the technology that offers their channels through apps, but the rental of a set-top box is required.\n\nOpposition from the cable industry, which has been anticipating Wheeler's move, came quickly after his official announcement. Comcast, the largestcable provider in the U.S., said the proposed regulation would hurt the technological development of apps.\n\n\"Heavy-handed government technology mandates have a long history of failure,\" the company said in a statement. \"The Chairman's approach would likely meet the same fate, while causing real damage to the thriving apps marketplace and real harm to consumers.\"\n\nCharter Communications called Wheeler's plan \"a valid goal,\" but argued the marketplace is already meeting consumer demand for apps that provide video service. \"The FCC's mandate threatens to bog down with regulations and bureaucracy the entire TV app market that consumers are increasingly looking to for innovation, choice and competition,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIt's not clear whether Wheeler's proposal will be approved by the FCC. Comissioner Michael O'Rielly echoed the concerns of the industry.\n\n\"I will review this proposal carefully over the coming days and weeks, but at the outset it appears to exist within a fantasy world of unlimited Commission authority,\" he said. \"The Commission is and must remain in the business of licensing spectrum and infrastructure, not content.\"\n\nMPAA Chairman and Chief Executive Chris Dodd said he will need assurance that an FCC mandate to provide streaming apps does not interfere with the ability of program producers and creators to negotiate issues related to online usage of their content.\n\n\"The FCC must not encroach upon copyright holders' discretion in how they exercise or license the exclusive rights,\" Dodd said.\n\nWheeler's proposal did receive praise", "greedy": "LOS ANGELES -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler wants to make sure that the Internet remains open and free for everyone.\n\nIn a speech at the University of Southern California on Thursday, Wheeler said the FCC is working to ensure that the Internet remains a \"free and open platform for innovation and expression", "top-k": "LOS ANGELES -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler wants to see a national standard for the Internet, but he's not going to make that a priority in his upcoming meeting with the Internet Association.\n\n\n\"We do not have a set date to have that conversation,\" said Wheeler in an interview with", "beam": "LOS ANGELES -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler wants to make it easier for Internet service providers (ISPs) to block or slow down websites that they don't like.\n\nIn a speech at the University of Southern California on Wednesday, Wheeler said he wants to make it easier for ISPs to", "greedy_mauve": 0.9637226324525383, "top-k_mauve": 0.9712435015928091, "beam_mauve": 0.984357126952706}, {"id": 255170, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Different cuts of beef\n\nNutritional value of each cut\n\nRecipes for each cut\n\nAnd much more\n\nBackground\n\nFor bodybuilders, beef is an important part of a healthy diet.

In this section, we will show you the following:\n\nMost American cattle breeds are descendents of animals imported, possibly by the Vikings, during the early 1000s. Columbus and other early explorers also brought cattle on board their ships. Today, over 100 million head of cattle live in the United States and Canada. Beef is available in many different cuts, including steaks, roasts, brisket, stew meat, and ground beef. Tender cuts come from the ribs and loin. Tougher cuts come from the rump and shoulder. Prime beef has thin layers of fat, called marbling, running visibly through the muscle. Choice beef has little or no marbling but a layer of pinkish fat on the outer edges.\n\nThe Importance Of Beef\n\nMany of us are trying to eat healthily. We are adding more whole grains and fresh vegetables to our diets, and eating less saturated fat. Beef is part of a healthy diet. Beef makes a meal filling, satisfying, and festive. Think back to the wonderful standing rib roasts of Christmas past, those made-to-order steaks for the annual 4th of July barbecue, or mom's famous spaghetti and meatball special. Beef is what makes the meal memorable. You can still enjoy these classics. Remember, while red meat does contain a fair amount of fat, it is also a concentrated source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Eaten in moderation, it can be a part of a well balanced diet.\n\nBeef is divided into primal cuts. From these larger sections, your butcher makes smaller cuts suitable for individual or family size portions. Different cuts require different treatment. For instance, chuck makes an excellent roast, but will be tough and chewy if pan-broiled. With this in mind, we have prepared this handy chart. The following is by no means an exhaustive list of the possible divisions of each section, but will give you some idea of the special characteristics and uses of each area. Besides being a simple anatomy lesson, it will help you make sense of that long meat counter.\n\nNutritional Breakdowns - Which Cut Is Best?\n\nEach cut has a different amount of calories, protein and fat. As a bodybuilder, the choice you make can make a big difference. Check out the table below. Highlights of the best from this table are below the table.\n\nNOTE: Beef does not contain any carbohydrates.\n\nCut Type Grams Protein Grams Fat Calories Chuck, 3 oz. 23.2 h20.2 282.2 Ribs, 3 oz. 18.6 25.1 306.1 Short Loin, 3 oz. 19.7 19.8 262.6 Sirloin, 3 oz. 23.6 13 219.3 Flank, 3 oz. 22.4 10.6 192.1 Round, 3 oz. 25.6 8.1 183.6 Beef Brisket, 3 oz. 21.3 24.2 309.4 Corned Beef Brisket, 3 oz. 15.4 16.1 213.3\n\nThe Winning Bodybuilding Cut?\n\nAlthough most of the beef cuts are pretty good when eaten in moderation, the Round cut is by far the best! It has the highest protein AND the least fat. Learn more about each type below and find great recipes!\n\nChuck\n\nMeat is muscle. Meat that has been heavily exercised tends to be tough, and chuck fits this description. However, chuck does have a saving grace. There is a lot of connective tissue in this area, in particular collagen. Collagen melts during cooking, making the meat intensely flavorful. Cuts from this area benefit from slow wet cooking methods, such as stewing, braising, or pot-roasting.\n\nBlade Roast - This inexpensive cut lies next to the ribs, and is more tender than most chuck. It makes an excellent roast. Alternatively, you can be cut the roast into a rib-eye steak, and use the meat above and below the bone for stir-fry dishes.\n\nChuck Steak - A good choice for kabobs if well marinated.\n\nNutritional Highlights\n\nChuck roast (fat trimmed to 1/4 inch [0.6cm], braised),, 3oz.

If you have not read the book, and don't wish to know how it all ends, please bookmark this page and save it until you're ready to read! Prior to Andres Muscheitti's film, there were a few reasons why Stephen King's IT was considered unadaptable in the medium, and only one of them was the extreme length of the story. Another is the fact that the end of the book winds up getting extremely trippy and weird in its third act, with both the kids and adults' storylines leading to confrontation with the titular monster on an inter-dimensional battlefield. Obviously this element was entirely left out of the recently released movie, but star Bill Skarsgard really wants to see IT: Chapter 2 fully embrace it. Discussing the nature and mind of Pennywise in the novel, he recently said, It's hardly answered in the novel, either. I mean, it's very abstract. And I kind of like that. It could be almost a sort of surrealistic sort of psychedelic trip if you go into the mind of Pennywise. And if you've read the novel you know that they do actually go into his mind. Or they go into this trans-dimensional place, and they sort of beat him in this place. Which might be interesting, what that place would be, and what would it look like. There's opportunities, I think, and I'm excited for it. Bill Skarsgard is currently promoting his second Stephen King adaptation of 2017, the new Hulu series Castle Rock, but while speaking with IGN at New York Comic-Con this past weekend he also took the time to talk about what he would like to see in IT: Chapter 2. The actor was asked about the possibility of the sequel delving deeper into his monstrous character's mind, and Skarsgard noted that he thinks there are some fantastic visual opportunities to explore with that idea in the source material. In the novel, there are a couple chapters that dive into the nature of Pennywise, and it's revealed that he is an ancient, interdimensional entity who feeds on fear for sustenance so that he can last through his 27-year hibernation periods. Defeating IT requires the fight being brought to ITs own home turf - in a \"ceremony\" called The Ritual of Chud - and how it's described in the book would be a sincere challenge to directly adapt on screen. The Losers Club performs the Ritual of Chud when they are both children and adults, but just because it wasn't featured in Andres Muschietti's IT doesn't mean that it won't wind up in IT: Chapter 2. In fact, Bill Skarsgard argues that the sequel actually should be a very different film, as what scares children and what scares adults are two very different things, and that deserves exploration. Said Skarsgard, The first movie worked so well at what it is trying to do, I think, and ultimately that is the kids' story, and you follow these kids and you sort of fall in love with these kids. And the second one will be the adult story. And I think the right way to do it is to make that movie actively different. ... I think there might be worth exploring sort of the psychological aspects of horror, but also maybe the sort of cosmological existence of this being. What is he, and where does he come from? When didn't actually know when we would be getting IT: Chapter 2 for what felt like a long time to an impatient mind - but that mystery was solved a few weeks back.

Hence, the current wave of anti-Brahmin actions has to be understood in that context.\n\nLinguistic Ethnic Nationalism + Marxism = Secessionist Nazi Cults\n\nDravidian polity has consistently used the term Aryan as a racist slur against Tamil Brahmin communities. The official magazine of Dravidian movement proclaimed on 28-09-1955: \"If we are to lynch the Aryans in the middle of the roads in broad day light all day long, today none shall care to question that\". However, in reality that was not the case. The Tamil Nadu government, then led by K Kamaraj as chief minister, did not hesitate to take action against Dravidian propaganda demeaning the sacred thread.\n\nSubsequently, the cultural reality and strains of real politics made even Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) refrain from rabid anti-Brahmin rhetoric. In 1955, C N Annadurai, who later became chief minister, explained that if they could destroy caste system by destroying Brahmins \u2013 the same way Hitler did with the Jews \u2013 it would be \"sensible to an extent\". But, he explained that the caste system, which he described as 'Aryanism' had become a part of Tamil society at large, and hence they had to resort to campaigning without violent means.\n\nDeep down they had strong hatred for Hinduism, which despite all social stigmas, still provided a democratic religious system, and hence it was an obstacle to their totalitarian ideologies and theologies. So, anti-Brahminism is aimed not just at Brahmins, but its ultimate aim is to destroy Hinduism and Hindu communities. Naturally, institutional and anti-Brahmin political movements get support from Christian and Islamic expansionist forces.\n\nIn 1950s, a bishop from Madurai, in his book on church and Dravidian movement, called the movement a time bomb that they have developed to destroy Hinduism. In 2017, Mathimaran, a rabid anti-Hindu Dravidianist, who calls Subramania Bharati a 'Brahmin-Hindu supremacist' is a guest in Christian institutions. The remarkable consistency in supporting the worst forms of anti-Hindu racial hate ideologies by Christian institutions is telling.\n\nSoon after Tony Joseph wrote a distorted report in The Hindu on the Aryan invasion and migration question as being settled through genetics in favour of the invasion/migration hypothesis, WhatsApp messages started spreading in many groups. In one of the groups of my old collegemates, a friend shared a message she had received. It went like this: \"The report of Tony Joseph had struck terror in the hearts of Brahmins in Tamil Nadu as it conclusively exposing them as aliens to this land. The report proves Tamils to be the original inhabitants of the land.\" And it ended with the usual call to share: \"If you are born a true Tamil share this message with other Tamils and spread the awareness.\"", "greedy": "Apart from cultural illiteracy and hate campaign in public space, the BJP has also been accused of using the issue of the 'love jihad' to polarise the electorate.\n\nThe BJP has been accused of using the issue of 'love jihad' to polarise the electorate.\n\nThe BJP", "top-k": "Apart from cultural illiteracy and hate campaign in public space, there are other issues at stake, especially the future of Indian culture, as the country is facing an unprecedented crisis in terms of the development and the survival of its culture.\n\n\"The Indian government is trying to keep the Indian people ignorant", "beam": "Apart from cultural illiteracy and hate campaign in public space, there is also a lack of understanding on the part of the government and the media about the nature of the problem.\n\n\"The government is not doing enough to address the problem.

Rebekah Rousi hung around two tall office towers in town, riding elevators up and down day after day, looking for patterns. When a bunch of people get into an elevator, she wondered, do they segregate in any predictable way? Do tall ones stand in the back? Do men stand in different places than women? Who looks where? She says she wasn't expecting or even predicting a particular configuration, but she found one.\n\nOver and over, she noticed that older \"more senior men in particular seem to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins.\"\n\nYounger men took up the middle ground.\n\nAnd in the front, facing the doors, backs to the guys, stood \"women of all ages.\"\n\nShe's not sure why. It wasn't segregation by height. It wasn't age, since older and younger women co-mingled. Clearly, the people in the back had the advantage of seeing everybody in the cabin, while people in the front had no idea who was behind them. Could there be a curiosity difference? A predatory difference?\n\nThere was a second pattern, one that broke along gender lines. \"Men,\" she wrote, \"looked in the side mirrors and the door mirrors\" to openly check out the other passengers, and/or themselves.\n\nWomen didn't do that. \"Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users (unless in conversation).\" They would only look at the mirrors (where they could check out the other passengers) when they were with other women. Eye-wise, the guys were roving, the ladies weren't.\n\n\"That's where I started thinking of power,\" Rebekah wrote me. The men who flocked to the back, who had a better view of their fellow passengers, were consistently older, more \"senior\" (I'm not sure how she knew that, but it's in her posted paper) and many of them \"weren't concerned with 'getting caught' looking in the mirror.\" They gazed freely, suggesting a sense of privilege. Younger, less powerful men seemed to avoid that space, choosing a middle ground. The back of the box, (unlike the back of the bus in Alabama civil rights days) she decided, might be the elevator power zone.\n\nOr ...\n\nPerhaps a gender analysis is too easy. Power hierarchies in elevators, she wrote, \"almost seemed too clich\u00e9.\" This could be about shyness. Bold people choose the back; shy people the front. Does that mean she thinks Australian women are more self-conscious than Australian men? She wouldn't go there, except to say, \"I don't really want people to know how vain I am, so looking in the mirror (as a woman or not) when others are in the lift ... is highly avoided.\" By this analysis, the back of the elevator is the Vanity-Unleashed zone.\n\nBasically, she's still puzzled. A pattern shows up. But the explanation, she said, slipping into academic shyness, \"awaits further analysis.\" Then she added, \"I'd be really interested to hear what your listeners (she means you, you reading this) have to say about the issue.\"\n\nThe always mischievous Latif Nasser (who is, I should mention, a regular contributor to Radiolab) read this post and sent me a video that describes a very different kind of elevator behavior.

According to Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, an overnight bidding war included escalating offers from The Weinstein Co., Netflix and Paramount.\n\nPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 The Birth of a Nation got a standing ovation, and it hadn't even started yet.\n\nMonday afternoon, the crowd rose to salute director/star/writer Nate Parker before it had seen a frame of his slavery drama, which centers its powerful story around a slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in 1831.\n\nThe timing was nothing short of incredible. Diversity discussions had dominated Sundance Film Festival for five days, after the Academy Awards announced all-white acting nominees for the second year in a row.\n\nThen The Birth of a Nation arrived, starkly and thoughtfully excavating the roots of American racism.\n\n\"I made this film for one reason \u2014 in the hope of creating change agents,\" said Parker during the film's Q&A. \"You can watch this film and see there are systems that were in place that were corrupt and corrupted people. And the legacy of that still lives with us.\"\n\nBorn a slave in Virginia, Turner was taught to read as a child and grew up to become a preacher. He had an affable relationship with his master, Samuel (Armie Hammer), and was able to marry a slave, Cherry (Aja Naomi King). But slave abuse increased as plantation owners became more paranoid, including an increasingly savage Samuel.\n\nNo longer able to justify their world through Bible verses, Turner ignites a slave rebellion, ultimately leading a 48-hour bloody attack.\n\n\"A labor of love pursued by Parker for seven years, the film vividly captures an assortment of slavery's brutalities while also underlining the religious underpinnings of Turner's justifications for his assaults on slaveholders,\" wrote The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nBirth is \"certain to be the most widely discussed and rousingly received film in the U.S. dramatic competition at Sundance this year,\" Variety said.\n\nOn stage, Parker described most films dealing with slavery in the South as \"desperately sanitized.\" Despite success found by recent films 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained, he spoke of an ongoing \"resistance to dealing with this material. So when the script goes out, people read it, they say, 'People won't want to see this. Another slave movie? Haven't we seen those?' \"\n\nSo will rapturous applause at Sundance turn into a mega-million distribution deal?

It revealed a 6% drop in annual emissions for the entire economy from 2008 to 2009, but does not directly show the extent of pollution from the oilsands production, which is greater than the greenhouse gas emissions of all the cars driven on Canadian roads.\n\nThe data also indicated that emissions per barrel of oil produced by the sector is increasing, despite claims made by the industry in an advertising campaign.\n\n\"The oilsands remain Canada's fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas pollution, and they're the subject of a huge amount of attention and scrutiny in Canada and internationally,\" said Clare Demerse, director of climate change at the Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based environmental research group. \"So it's very disappointing to see Environment Canada publish a 500-page report that leaves out these critical numbers \u2014 especially when last year's edition included them.\"\n\nOverall, Environment Canada said that the oilsands industry was responsible for about 6.5% of Canada's annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2009, up from 5% in 2008. This also indicates a growth in emissions that is close to about 300% since 1990, which cancel out many reductions in pollution from other economic sectors.\n\nThe report attributes the 6% decrease in Canada's overall emissions to the economic slowdown, but it also credits efforts by the Ontario government to reduce production of coal-fired electricity as a significant factor.\n\nEnvironment Canada provided the oilsands numbers in response to questions from Postmedia News about why it had omitted the information from its report after publishing more detailed data in previous years. A department spokesman explained that \"some\" of the information was still available in the latest report, which still meets Canada's reporting obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\n\"The information is presented in this way to be consistent with UNFCCC reporting requirements, which are divided into broad, international sectors,\" wrote Mark Johnson in an email.\n\nHe was not immediately able to answer questions about who made the decision in government to exclude the numbers from the oilsands or provide a detailed explanation about changes in emissions.\n\nAn industry spokesman said it favoured more transparency from the government, suggesting that some of the figures may be misleading because of changes in methods used to identify and calculate emissions.\n\n\"It's just too bad you weren't able to get a hold of (Environment Canada) on this one, because here I am telling you my understanding of what's going on, but really it's best to hear directly from them,\" said Greg Stringham, vice-president of oilsands and markets at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \"We report the information to them, and they choose to pass it on \u2014 they must pass it on the UN. But then they choose how to disclose it and put it out there.\"\n\nAlthough Stringham said that the industry figures did not show any significant growth in emissions per barrel of oil produced, the full report noted an intensity increase of 14.5% from 2008 to 2009, \"mainly the result of a new integrated mining and upgrading facility as well as a new integrated in-situ bitumen extraction and upgrading facility,\" that were not operating at \"peak efficiencies.\"\n\nEmissions from a mining category, which includes oilsands extraction, saw a 371% increase in greenhouse gas pollution, according to the report. But other categories showed significant decreases due, in part, to the recession, but also because of changes in use of fuel and manufacturing operations.\n\nEnvironment Canada's report recognizes that climate change is occurring, mainly due to an increase in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. The objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize these emissions in order to prevent dangerous changes to the climate.\n\nCritics have suggested the Harper government is deliberately trying to delay international action to fight climate change, following revelations, reported last fall by Postmedia News, that it had set up a partnership with the Alberta government, industry and several federal departments to fight pollution-reduction policies from other countries that target the oilsands through lobbying and public relations.\n\nEnvironment Minister Peter Kent has said the federal government is committed to reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions and will introduce its plan to regulate pollution from the oilsands within months. But he has also acknowledged that existing federal and provincial policies would still result in an increase in emissions over the next decade.\n\nAlthough the report was due in April, during the last election campaign, Canada was the last country to file its submission.

On its face, it echoes a prime point of contention for Democrats probing all of Trump's Cabinet picks, many of whom boast extensive private business and finance ties.\n\nBut Mnuchin is slated to be the Trump Administration's top economic official, making those ties even more susceptible to potential conflicts, aides say -- the types of potential conflicts Mnuchin himself appeared to draw attention to inadvertently during his confirmation hearing.\n\nThe focus has trained on a series of finance entities, all offshoots of the hedge fund run by Mnuchin up until he was selected as Trump's pick to be the country's economic point person.\n\nForeign investors\n\nAsked specifically about the investment makeup of the offshore entity during his hearing, Mnuchin repeatedly said it was created to provide opportunities for pension funds and non-profits to invest. There were also \"a small number of foreign investors,\" Mnuchin told lawmakers.\n\nBut the offshore entity and a series of other finance vehicles, some of which weren't originally disclosed by Mnuchin during the financial disclosure process, hold gross assets of more than $240 million, according to an SEC filing reviewed by CNN. Significant percentages of each were held by foreign investors, according to the filing, and one was 100 percent owned by foreign investors.\n\nJUST WATCHED Steve Mnuchin in 60 seconds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Steve Mnuchin in 60 seconds 01:03\n\nMnuchin's failure to initially disclose his relationship with the funds, along with his minimizing the scope of foreign investment in them during the hearing, has Democrats questioning whether it was part of a deliberate effort to steer them away.\n\n\"Misleading -- and that's the most charitable way you could say it,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said of Mnuchin's explanation during an interview. \"You walked away thinking that almost the only people were churches and pensions (investing in those entities.)\"\n\nOne fund, Dune Capital International LTD., listed a gross asset value of $35.1 million in the 2013 disclosure. The disclosure, which identifies Mnuchin as one of three \"Partners and Directors\" of the Cayman Islands-based entity, claims 28% of the underlying fund ownership came from foreign investors, according to the SEC filing reviewed by CNN.\n\nA second US-based entity with $18.4 million in gross asset value, DE International Holdings LLC, is listed as 100% owned by \"non-US persons,\" according to the SEC filing.\n\nDune Entertainment Holdings LLC, which had a gross asset value of $124.8 million, listed 43% of its ownership as coming from foreign persons or entities. Two additional entities, Dune Entertainment International and Dune Entertainment LP, held in total nearly $62 million in gross asset value. The underlying assets were 100% and 43% beneficially owned by non-US persons, respectively. The portfolio played a role, at least in part, in the financing of Mnuchin's extensive financing of Hollywood projects.\n\n\"We're talking about foreign investors,\" Wyden said. \"I don't have a lot of evidence right now that all these non-profits and pensions were interested in investing in movies.\"\n\nThe foreign investment in the offshoots was entirely legal and isn't required to be disclosed. But Mnuchin's role in the entities was supposed to be disclosed to the committee. It wasn't. At least not until the Democratic investigative staff on the panel discovered the SEC document.\n\nMissing paperwork\n\nMnuchin, for his part, blamed the missing paperwork on the byzantine nature of the disclosure process. In a private interview with committee staff, aides said, Mnuchin acknowledged that his responses to the committee had not, as he had stated, been \"true, accurate and complete.\" He twice was forced to revise his initial disclosure questionnaire. He stated his role in the entities was \"inadvertently missed\" during the disclosure process.\n\nMnuchin's confirmation spokesman didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.

For example, if you archive a conversation, it will appear in the archived folder for you and all the moderators of your subreddit.\n\nAll Mail\n\nThe All Mail folder is a combined view of the New, In Progress and Notification folders.\n\nNew\n\nThe New folder contains incoming conversations that have yet to be responded to by a moderator. Once a moderator responds to a conversation in new, it will move to the In Progress folder. Once a conversation leaves the New folder, it cannot be put back.\n\nIn Progress\n\nThe In Progress folder contains conversations that have been responded to by a moderator, but have not yet been archived. Unarchiving a conversation will move it back to the In Progress folder.\n\nArchived\n\nThe Archived folder contains conversations that a moderator has deliberately archived. If an archived conversation is responded to or Unarchived it will move to the In Progress folder. Conversations in the archived folder are marked as read for all moderators.\n\nThe following message types are automatically routed to the Archived folder:\n\nBan Notification\n\nMute Notification\n\nHighlighted\n\nHighlighted contains all the messages that your moderation team have chosen to highlight with the Highlight action. A conversations highlighted status exists across folders, so for example you can highlight an archived message for future reference and it will also appear in the highlighted folder. Whenever viewing conversations in the Highlighted folder, we will also display an icon indicating which folder it currently resides in.\n\nMod Discussions\n\nMod discussions contains conversations that are only visible to you and other moderators of the subreddit. These conversations will always remain in the Mod Discussion folder and never appear in New, In Progress or Archived.\n\nNotifications\n\nThe Notifications folder contains conversations that were automatically generated from your subreddit. If a conversation in the notifications folder receives a reply it will be automatically moved to the In Progress folder.\n\nMessage types that will appear in Notifications include:\n\nMessages from AutoModerator\n\nAdd moderator messages\n\nRemove moderator messages\n\nAny message with the subject that begins with [Notification]\n\nReading Modmail Messages\n\nThe main modmail view displays a list of conversations. Each conversation is composed of messages. Only the most recent message is shown in this view. To view the entire conversation you click on it to be taken to the message view.\n\nSubreddit Selector\n\nBy default we'll show you modmail from all of the subreddits you moderate. You can use the subreddit selector to filter to messages from specific subreddits.\n\nRead States\n\nThe background color of a conversation or message indicates whether it contains a message that you have not read. Read-states are specific to each moderator. If one moderator reads something, it will still appear as unread for other moderators.\n\nA moderator can mark all conversations in the current folder as read using the 'mark all as read' button in the conversation view.\n\nA moderator can mark all messages in a conversation as unread by clicking on 'mark as unread' whilst in the message view.\n\nConversations in the archived folder are marked as read for all moderators.\n\nUser info panel\n\nWhen reading a modmail conversation you will see information about the user in relation to your subreddit in the sidebar. This includes:\n\nAccount standing (banned, muted, etc)\n\nRecent posts in your subreddit\n\nRecent comments in your subreddit\n\nRecent modmail conversations with the user\n\nThis sidebar also allows you to take actions such as muting.\n\nRead Counts\n\nThe number of conversations that contain messages that have not been read is displayed alongside each folder name.\n\nSending Messages\n\nReplying To Conversations\n\nWhen responding to a conversation there are three different reply options available via dropdown menu:\n\nReply as myself\n\nReply as the subreddit\n\nCreate a Private Moderator Note\n\nReply as myself\n\nThis is the default option.

The main issue stemmed from Markdown not providing a way to temporarily escape from its text transformations, so some L A TEX would get interpreted as Markdown.\n\nThe only way I know of to prevent text transformations in Markdown is through the code block (prefix with 4+ spaces) and inline code (surround with ` ) features. However, both of those wrap the result in some HTML tag ( <pre> for the first, <code> for the second). I decided to use the inline code feature as the basis for inserting my math.\n\nI can insert math by typing, for example \\`\\\\\\( \\\\del \\\\cdot \\\\vec{B} = 0 \\\\\\)\\` . To make this work, I had to use the following MathJax configuration:\n\nMathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'] } });\n\nThis prevents MathJax from skipping <code> tags. This could potentially cause issues if I used the sequences \\\\\\( , \\\\\\[ , or $$ in a normal (non-math) code block, but I think it's safe to say that those sequences won't show up in most of my code.\n\nThe next step was to make sure MathJax <code> tags weren't actually styled like \"normal\" <code> tags. To do this, I added this to my MathJax configuration:\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue(function() { // Fix <code> tags after MathJax finishes running. This is a // hack to overcome a shortcoming of Markdown.

Hoffner and his co-defendant Archie Dixon wanted to get hold of their buddy Chris Hammer's car. So they, with the assistance of Kristen Wilkerson (Dixon's girlfriend) . . . Feh. Don't make me tell it. Here's the official version, from the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion in Hoffner's appeal.\n\nIn the early morning of September 22, Hoffner, Dixon, and Hammer went to Wilkerson's house. Once there, Hoffner and Dixon attacked Hammer. Hoffner restrained Hammer in a headlock while Dixon beat him. Hoffner tried to break Hammer's neck, and Dixon struck Hammer in the head with a wine bottle. Hoffner and Dixon then tied Hammer to a bunk-bed ladder, and Dixon went through Hammer's wallet, taking out his money, birth certificate, and Social Security card. Then Hoffner and Dixon discussed how they should dispose of Hammer's body. While Hammer remained tied to the bunk-bed ladder, Hoffner and Dixon left Wilkerson's house to dig a grave. Hoffner and Dixon returned to Wilkerson's house and they, along with Wilkerson, drove Hammer, blindfolded, to the gravesite in Hammer's car. Wilkerson stayed at the car while Hoffner and Dixon walked Hammer into the woods, where they permitted Hammer to smoke a cigarette. Then they gagged and again blindfolded Hammer, tied his hands and feet behind his back, grabbed him by his arms and legs, and dropped him into the grave, still alive. At one point, Hammer was able to remove the gag from his mouth and free one of his legs. Hoffner jumped into the grave and placed his foot over Hammer's mouth when Hammer yelled for help. Hoffner and Dixon then held Hammer down and covered him with dirt. After Hammer was completely buried, Hoffner and Dixon walked back and forth across the grave, packing down the dirt. Hoffner, Dixon, and Wilkerson then returned to Wilkerson's house in Hammer's car.\n\nOK, got that? Now, let's start again.\n\nThe jury returned its verdict recommending that Tim Hoffner be executed, that he should be killed in the name of the people of the State of Ohio. And the judge, as judges pretty much all do after any jury trial, thanked them for their service. It is, he said, a difficult thing the county asked you to do, but a vitally important thing.\n\nThen he added that if any of the jurors needed therapy as a result of performing this service, the county would pay for it.\n\nThere were three executions scheduled for last week.\n\nKelly Gissendaner, on death row in Georgia, didn't kill anyone herself though she arranged for the 1997 murder of her husband, Douglas Gissander. Gregory Owen, the actual killer, was her lover at the time. He's doing life with a chance of parole. Whatever, whoever Gissendaner was then, she'd changed, showed remorse, provided support and counsel for other prisoners.\n\nRichard Glossip, on death row in Oklahoma, didn't kill anyone, either. It was Justin Sneed, serving a life sentence for the crime, who murdered Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where they both worked. The state's theory is that Glossip put Sneed up to it. The evidence supporting that claim, never strong, has pretty much completely unraveled.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Alfredo Prieto, on death row in Virginia, did kill people himself, at least three and maybe half a dozen more that he's been linked to. He was on death row in California for the 1990 rape and murder of Yvette Woodruff when DNA tied him to killings in Virginia. He was extradited there, tried and again sentenced to be killed for the 1988 murders of Rachel Raver and Warren Fulton, III.[1] There's a fair chance that Prieto was mentally retarded. If so, his execution would be unconstitutional. The courts showed no interest in finding out.\n\nGissendaner was to be executed Tuesday, Glossip Wednesday, Prieto Thursday. In each case the Pope, who'd made a point of calling for abolition of the death penalty when he spoke to Congress, made a specific request that the sentence be commuted. None of the sentences were.\n\nIn each case, last minute litigation raised questions about what would happen. None of it staved off the executions.

(AP Photo/Dawn Villella, file) (Photo: Dawn Villella, AP) Story Highlights Current Michigan law would allow for a wolf hunt in 2015.\n\nProposals 14-1 and 14-2 will have no authority unless current law overturned via legal challenges.\n\nThere will be no Michigan wolf hunt in 2014.\n\nMichigan voters who care whether the state should allow wolf hunting can have their say next week on the general election ballot.\n\nSort of.\n\nTwo proposals are on the Nov. 4 ballot that would either allow or prohibit state officials from holding another public hunting season for wolves. However, both proposals are essentially null and void -- regardless of how Michiganders vote on them -- because of action taken by the Legislature over the summer.\n\nAdvocates on both sides of the issue want voters to have their say because the proposals could become important in the future.\n\nThe proposals are the result of a complicated political chess match between those who oppose public wolf hunting and those who think it's an important tool for managing the former endangered species.\n\nTo help you understand what you're voting on, we talked to the non-partisan Citizens Research Council to put together a primer on both proposals and why they may not matter until the future.\n\nThe history\n\nFirst, Wolves are native to Michigan but were nearly wiped out in the 19th and early 20th centuries by hunting and state-sanctioned bounties.\n\nIn 1973, when Congress created the federal endangered species list, only six wolves were known to still exist in the Michigan wild.\n\nUnder federal protection, wolf recovery was slow. But starting in 1989, the numbers began to rise in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, along with the hope that one day the animals would rebound enough to return to state control.\n\nTo prepare for that possibility, the state convened a task force in 2005 to create a wolf management plan. Members of the task force included all stakeholders in wolf management, including biologists, representatives of Michigan's Indian tribes, sporting groups and wolf advocates.\n\nAn overview of wolves in Michigan\n\nBy 2007, the wolf population in the Upper Peninsula topped 500 -- far exceeding the recovery benchmark of 100 set by the federal government, making the Great Lakes gray wolf one of the most successful recovery stories in the history of the endangered species list.\n\nAt the same time, however, some Upper Peninsula residents began to complain that wolves were edging too close for comfort. Some farmers reported that wolves were killing livestock, and U.P. citizens reported wolves encroaching on towns and yards.\n\nIn 2007, U.S. Fish and Wildlife sought to remove Great Lakes gray wolves from federal protection, but the Humane Society of the United States sued to delay the move. A federal court ruled in favor of the Humane Society, and wolves remained under endangered species protection for several more years.\n\nFinally, in 2012, Great Lakes gray wolves were removed from the endangered species list, putting the state of Michigan back in control of its wolf population.\n\nThe conversation - or the debate\n\nMichigan's wolf management plan highlighted several methods for controlling the wolf population once they were removed from the endangered species list, including a potential public wolf hunt.\n\nRead the wolf management plan\n\nIn December 2012, less than a year after wolves were removed from the list, the Legislature passed a bill designating wolves game animals. It was signed by Gov. Rick Snyder and became Public Act 520.\n\nThe new law cleared the way for the Natural Resources Commission -- a seven-member body appointed by the governor -- to establish a hunting season for wolves.\n\nProponents, including the state Department of Natural Resources, cited several reasons for backing wolf hunts. The DNR told lawmakers at a hearing that hunting would be one of many tools used by wildlife officials to control the wolf population.\n\n\"While the wolf population offers benefits, it also poses significant costs and concerns to some Michigan residents,\" Trevor VanDyke, the DNR's legislative liaison, told a Senate committee. \"This would be another tool that would allow for proper management and implementation of the wolf management plan, and we think we'd use this as a tool to reduce those negative impacts and conflicts with livestock and humans.\"\n\nOpponents believed it was too soon to talk about a hunt. At the same hearing, wolf advocate Nancy Warren of the National Wolfwatcher Coalition questioned the scientific need for hunting as a management tool.\n\n\"There is no scientific evidence or research to support the need for", "greedy": "** FILE ** This July 16, 2004 file photo shows a man walking past a sign for the \"Bible Study Center\" in the Old City of Jerusalem.

Every time I write an article or blog on wireless LAN security, someone has to come along and regurgitate one of these myths. If that weren't bad enough, many \"so called\" security experts propagated these myths through speaking engagements and publications and many continue to this day. Many wireless LAN equipment makers continue to recommend many of these schemes to this day. One would think that the fact that none of these schemes made it in to the official IEEE 802.11i security standard would give a clue to their effectiveness, but time and time again that theory is proven wrong. To help you avoid the these schemes, I've created the following list of the six dumbest ways to secure your wireless LAN.\n\nWireless LAN security hall of shame\n\nMAC filtering: This is like handing a security guard a pad of paper with a list of names. Then when someone comes up to the door and wants entry, the security guard looks at the person's name tag and compares it to his list of names and determines whether to open the door or not. Do you see a problem here? All someone needs to do is watch an authorized person go in and forge a name tag with that person's name. The comparison to a wireless LAN here is that the name tag is the MAC address. The MAC address is just a 12 digit long HEX number that can be viewed in clear text with a sniffer. A sniffer to a hacker is like a hammer to a carpenter except the sniffer is free. Once the MAC address is seen in the clear, it takes about 10 seconds to cut-paste a legitimate MAC address in to the wireless Ethernet adapter settings and the whole scheme is defeated. MAC filtering is absolutely worthless since it is one of the easiest schemes to attack. The shocking thing is that so many large organizations still waste the time to implement these things. The bottom line is, MAC filtering takes the most effort to manage with zero ROI (return on investment) in terms of security gain.\n\nSSID hiding: There is no such thing as \"SSID hiding\". You're only hiding SSID beaconing on the Access Point. There are 4 other mechanisms that also broadcast the SSID over the 2.4 or 5 GHz spectrum. The 4 mechanisms are; probe requests, probe responses, association requests, and re-association requests. Essentially, youre talking about hiding 1 of 5 SSID broadcast mechanisms. Nothing is hidden and all youve achieved is cause problems for Wi-Fi roaming when a client jumps from AP to AP. Hidden SSIDs also makes wireless LANs less user friendly. You dont need to take my word for it. Just ask Robert Moskowitz who is the Senior Technical Director of ICSA Labs in his white paper Debunking the myth of SSID hiding.\n\nLEAP authentication: The use of Cisco LEAP authentication continues to be the single biggest mistake that corporations make with their wireless LAN because they leave themselves wide open to attack. Cisco still tells their customers that LEAP is fine so long as strong passwords are used. The problem is that strong passwords are an impossibility for humans to deal with. If you doubt this, try a password audit of all the users in your organization and see how long it takes to crack 99% of all passwords. 99% of organizations will flunk any password audit for most of their users within hours. Any attempt to enforce strong passwords will result in passwords written on sticky notes. Since Joshua Wright released a toolthat can crackLEAP with lighting speed, Cisco was forced to come out with a better alternative to LEAP and they came up with an upgradeto LEAP calledEAP-FAST. Unfortunately, EAP-FAST still falls short in security with its default installation. Although Cisco makes LEAP and EAP-FAST freely available to partners for the client end, the same is not true for Access Points.LEAP and EAP-FAST are essentially two proprietary protocolsthat Cisco employs as a strategy to monopolize the Access Point market. There are open standards based EAP mechanisms like EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP which are all much more secure than either LEAP or EAP-FAST and they work on all Access Points and client adapters, not just Cisco. Cisco does support open standard EAPs just like everyone else so you should always use open EAP standards to get better security and avoid the hardware lock-in.\n\nDisable DHCP: This is much more of waste of time than it is a security break. DHCP allows the automatic assignment of IP addresses and other configurations. Disabling DHCP has zero security value and just wastes time. It would take a hacker about 10 seconds to figure out the IP scheme of any network and simply assign their own IP address.

I finally got health insurance and was seen by a neurologist. I was diagnosed soon after.\"To attempt to preserve the muscle that's left in his hands and arms, he can no longer work as a wedding photographer. The equipment is too heavy, and the days are too long. Once muscle is lost, it cannot be regained, and the risk is not worth it.

Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost.
